- kdebindings: various problems, including
dcopjava/tests/Makefile.am: unknown source extension .java for test.class
kdeobjc/kangaroo/Makefile.am: unknown source extension .m for kangaroo

- kde-i18n got top level build trees as subdirs - not yet supported

- comments aren't stripped out correctly. At least in INCLUDES

- pics_DATA = *.png does not work - as it does in automake + srcdir=builddir, it's nice to support it too

- make nofinal

- add better error message for recursion problems

- add support for 'export'. Info:make Node: Variables/Recursion

- Possible code cleanups:
	* Command line parsing can be ported to optparse, perhaps

- automake allows to specify nodist_ and dist_ prefices (not used in 
  KDE fortunately). unsermake should at least ignore these:
     dist_sbin_SCRIPTS = my_script
