/** \mainpage libkcal - The KDE calendar access library.

This library provides access to and handling of calendar data. It supports the
standard formats iCalendar and vCalendar and the group scheduling standard iTIP.

<b>Important:</b> This is mainly a KDE PIM internal library. The API might be
subject to source and binary incompatible changes.

If you use this library for kdepim-external projects, please let us know, so we
can coordinate possible changes.

libkcal development is discussed on the <a
href="mailto:kde-pim@kde.org">kde-pim@kde.org</a> mailing list.
