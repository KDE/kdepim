These files are intended to check which things break on an upgrade and 
if our compat classes are working. 
The files cover all different cases of recurrence rules that could be 
produced by KOrganizer from KDE 3.4.


The reference data are the occurences 
that were generated with KOrganizer from KDE 3.4. They do not alway follow 
the RFC, but we need to ensure that the rrule is adjusted by a Compat class 
so that the new version produces the same set of occurences. Things that 
are known as broken in KOrganizer from KDE 3.4:
 1) If the start date does not match the RRULE, it doesn't appear 
    as an occurences (rfc 2445 says the DTSTART is always the first 
		occurence, except when it's excluded by EXDATE or EXRULE).
