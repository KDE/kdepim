Coding Style
============

- No Tabs.
- Indent with 2 spaces.
- Put Spaces between brackets and arguments of functions.
- For if, else, while and similar statements put the brackets on the same line
  as the statement.

- Put classes in files, which have the same name as the class, but only lower-case letters.
- Designer-generated files should have a name classname_base.ui and should contain a class called
  ClassnameBase.
- Classes inheriting from designer-generated classes have the same name as the generated class, but 
  without the Base suffix.

- For class, variable, function names seperate multiple words by upper-casing the words precedeed
  by other words.
- Class names start with an upper-case letter.
- Function names start with a lower-case letter.
- Variable names start with a lower-case letter.
- Member variables of a class start with "m" followed by an upper-case letter.
