See kdelibs/kabc/HACKING or http://korganizer.kde.org/develop/hacking.html for
general coding style conventions.

Additional conventions for libkcal and KOrganizer:

- Don't use dynamic_cast. In most cases the use of dynamic_cast is an indication
for design problems. In addition it isn't always available, e.g. when compiling
without run-time type information for KOrganizer/Embedded.
