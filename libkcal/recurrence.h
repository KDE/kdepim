class RecurrenceRule;

/**
  This class represents a recurrence rule for a calendar incidence.

  It manages all recurrence rules, recurrence date/times, exception rules
  and exception date times that can appear inside calendar items.
  Each recurrence rule and exception rule is represented as an object
  of type RecurrenceRule.

  For the simple case where at most one recurrence
  rule is present, this class provides shortcut methods to set the type:
    setMinutely()
    setHourly()
    setDaily()
    setWeekly()
    setMonthly()
    setYearly()
  to set/get general information about the recurrence:
    setEndDate()
    setEndDateTime()
    duration()
    durationTo()
    setDuration()
    frequency()
    setFrequency()
  and to set/get specific information about the recurrence within the interval:
    days()
    monthDays()
    monthPositions()
    yearDays()
    yearDates()
    yearMonths()
    yearPositions()
    addMonthlyPos()
    addMonthlyDate()
    addYearlyDay()
    addYearlyDate()
    addYearlyPos()
    addYearlyMonth()
  These are all available so that you don't have to work on the RecurrenceRule
  objects themselves.
  In other words, in that simple situation the interface stays almost the
  same compared to the old Recurrence class, which allowed only one
  recurrence rule.

  As soon as your recurrence consists of multiple recurrence rules or exception
  rules, you cannot use the methods mentioned above any more (since each rule
  will have a different type and different settings). If you still call
  any of them, the set*ly methods will remove all rules and add one rule with
  the specified type. The add* and the other set* methods will change only
  the first recurrence rule, but leave the others untouched.
