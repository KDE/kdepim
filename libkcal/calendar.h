  This is the main "calendar" object class for KOrganizer.  It holds
  information like all appointments/events, user information, etc. etc.
  one calendar is associated with each CalendarView (@see calendarview.h).
  This is an abstract base class defining the interface to a calendar. It is
  implemented by subclasses like @see CalendarLocal, which use different
  methods to store and access the data.

  Ownership of events etc. is handled by the following policy: As soon as an
  event (or any other subclass of IncidenceBase) object is added to the
  Calendar by addEvent() it is owned by the Calendar object. The Calendar takes
  care of deleting it. All Events returned by the query functions are returned
  as pointers, that means all changes to the returned events are immediately
  visible in the Calendar. You shouldn't delete any Event object you get from
  Calendar.
