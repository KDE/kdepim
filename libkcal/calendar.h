/**
   @class Calendar

   This is the main "calendar" object class.  It holds information like
   Incidences(Events, To-dos, Journals), user information, etc. etc.

   This is an abstract base class defining the interface to a calendar. It is
   implemented by subclasses like CalendarLocal, which use different
   methods to store and access the data.

   <b>Ownership of Incidences</b>:

   Incidence ownership is handled by the following policy: As soon as an
   Incidence (or any other subclass of IncidenceBase) object is added to the
   Calendar by an add...() method it is owned by the Calendar object.
   The Calendar takes care of deleting it.  All Incidences returned by the
   query functions are returned as pointers so that changes to the returned
   Incidences are immediately visible in the Calendar.  Do <em>Not</em>
   delete any Incidence object you get from Calendar.

   <b>Time Zone Handling</b>:

   - Incidence Storing:
      - By default, (when LocalTime is unset) Incidence dates will have the
        "UTC" time zone when stored into a calendar file.
      - To store Incidence dates without a time zone (i.e, "floating time
        zone") LocalTime must be set using the setLocalTime() method.

   - Incidence Viewing:
      - By default, Incidence dates will have the "UTC" time zone when
        read from a calendar.
      - To view Incidence dates using another time zone TimeZoneId must
        be set using the setTimeZoneId() method, or the TimeZoneId can
        be passed to the Calendar constructor.
      - It is permitted to switch viewing time zones using setTimeZoneId()
        as desired after the Calendar object has been constructed.

   - Note that:
      - The Calendar class doesn't do anything with TimeZoneId: it simply
        saves it for later use by the ICalFormat class.
      - The ICalFormat class takes TimeZoneId and applies it to loaded
        Incidences before returning them in ICalFormat::load().
      - Each Incidence can have its own time zone (or have a floating
        time zone).
      - Once an Incidence is loaded it is adjusted to use the viewing
        time zone, TimeZoneId.
      - Depending on the LocalTime setting, all loaded Incidences are stored
        either in UTC or without a time zone (floating time zone).
