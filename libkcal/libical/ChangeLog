2001-03-26  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalparameter.h icalparameter_rsvp_* routines now take, return
 	ICAL_RSVP_TRUE and ICAL_RSVP_FALSE, not 0 and 1

2001-03-25  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalrecur.c Many changes to get YEARLY rules working and fix
 	other errors. Recurrences are stil broken, but more types of rue
 	now work.

2001-03-16  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalparameter.c Changed icalparameter_new_from_string() to
 	icalparameter_new_from_value_string(). Created new
 	icalparameter_new_from_string() that takes strings of
 	form"PARAMNAME=PARAMVALUE"

	* *_XNAME changes all _XNAME enumerations to _X

	* derived props, values, parameters. Seperated out derived
 	proeprties, parameters and values into their own files. This makes
 	it easier to auto generate all of the enumerations for values,
 	parameters and proeprties.

	* icalenum.h Major changes to icalenum. Movel all of the
 	icalenum_* values to other modules, and changed the names. Look
 	for #defines in icalenum.h tying the old name to the new
 	name. Also moved all of the enumerations into other files.

	
	
2001-02-26  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* src/libical/icalproperty.c Added
 	icalproperty_set_parameter_from_string and
 	icalproperty_set_value_from_string to aid in binding to Python 

2001-02-15  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* design-data/prop-to-value.txt Made a new CSV file,
 	properties.cvs That collects property-to-value and default value
 	information

	* src/libical/icalproperty.{c,h}.in Moved auto generated code into
 	icalderivedproperty.{c,h} and created icalderivedproperty.{c,h}.in

	

2001-02-14  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* src/libical/Makefile.am: Sigh, automake is dumber than i thought

2001-02-12  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* src/test/Makefile.am: link with the static versions

	* src/python/Makefile.am: use include dir discovered in configure checks

	* src/python/.cvsignore: shush

	* src/libical/icalrestriction.c: remove autogenerated file
	
	* src/libical/Makefile.am: the generated files are now disted so
	look for them in the source dir rather than the build dir

	* src/Makefile.am: Only build the python dir if all the configure
	stuff checked out

	* configure.in: Remove shared library disabling and add a python
	check and allow for the python bindings to not be built

2001-02-11  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* src/python/Makefile.am Tweaked makefile to use automake more,
 	but it stil isn't quie right.

2001-02-09  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* Shush cvs
	
2001-02-09  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* src/libical/Makefile.am: Slightly over zealous during the merge
	
2001-02-09  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* src/libical/Makefile.am: Correct typo

	* Removal of more auto generated files
	
2001-02-09  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* Removal of various auto generated files
	
2001-02-09  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* src/libical/icalparameter.c.in (icalparameter_new_from_string):
	its NEEDS-ACTION rather than NEEDSACTION
	(icalparameter_as_ical_string): ditto

2001-02-09  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* python Added src/python directory. Inserted SWIG wrapper files,
 	and a simple interface to Component, Time, Duration, Period and
 	Store.

	* icallangbind.c More experimental work

	* icalduration.{c,h}, icalperiod.{c,h} Broke out period and
 	duration types into their own files

2001-02-06  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@ximian.com>

	* src/libical/icallangbind.c: Added a missing #include here.

	* src/libical/icalrecur.c (icalrecur_add_bydayrules): Copy the
	passed in const vals since we change it.
	
2001-02-06  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaltime.c Changed icaltime_from_day_of_year to run mktime in
 	the UTC timezone. This fixed a bug where it would return one day
 	eariler for some timezones.

2001-02-05  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@ximian.com>

	* src/libical/Makefile.am (COMBINEDHEADERS): `icalvalue.h',
	`icalparameter.h', `icalproperty.h' and `icalrestriction.h' are
	created in the builddir so they shouldn't be prefixed with
	`$(top_builddir)/src/libical'.
	
2001-01-26  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalproperty.c.in Improved icalproperty_as_ical_string() to
 	eliminate the possibility of having a VALUE parameter that does
 	not match the actual kind of value.

	* icalvalue.c.in made icalvalue_*_trigger() and
 	icalvalue_*_datetimeperiod non-autogenerated. These routines were
 	for combined value type -- non standard values that can have more
 	than on standard value type. These non-standard types now delegate
 	to stadard types.

2001-01-24  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalfileset.c fixed icalfileset_read-from_file so it will handle
 	lines longer than 80 char properly.

2001-01-23  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Don't AC_INIT on an autogenerated file that does not
	exist beforehand
	
2001-01-23  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icltime.c Removed all of the _local_ routines and simplified
 	icaltime_utc_offset and icaltime_as_timet

	* regression.c Added tests for triggers and improvements to icaltime.c

	* icaltypes.c Addedd icaltriggertype_from_string and changed
 	icaltriggertype to be a struct

2001-01-22  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaltime.c implemented icaldurationtype_from_string to parse the
 	string it self, rather than use lex/yacc

2001-01-15  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalfileset.c Many improvements. File locking now works, and so
 	does searching with icalfileset_select()

2001-01-08  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* Makefile.am Remove spaces after -I in several 
	Makefile.am routines. 

	* icalset.c removed return statements from some void functions.

	* icalparameter.c.in Added break to default: case that had no
 	body. Compilers on Solaris and Tru64 UNIX complained.

2001-01-02  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaltime.c Changed icaldurationtype_from_time and _as_timet to
 	_from_int and _as_int. This is a change interface that may break
 	some code.

	* icalgauge.c icalgaugeimpl.h, icalgauge.h., Rewrote gauge code to
 	use pvl-lists directly, instead of trying to reuse icalcomponent.

2000-12-13  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* src/libicalvcal/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add
	`$(top_builddir)/src/libical' to the include directory list.

	* src/libical/Makefile.am (icalparameter.h): Use `$(srcdir)'.
	(icalparameter.c): Likewise.
	(icalproperty.h): Likewise.
	(icalproperty.c): Likewise.
	(icalvalue.h): Likewise.
	(icalvalue.c): Likewise.
	(icalrestriction.c): Likewise.
	(COMBINEDHEADERS): `icalvalue.h', `icalparameter.h' and
	`icalproperty.h' are in builddir, not srcdir, so fix the list to
	use `$(top_builddir)' instead of `$(top_srcdir)'.
	(all): Removed.
	(BUILT_SOURCES): Move `ical.h' here instead.
	(ical.h): Don't depend on `(BUILT_SOURCES)'; this a built source
	itself.
	
2000-12-12  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalparser.c Addedd support for x-parameters. 

	* icalenum.c Fixed icalenum_parameter_type_to_string and
 	icalenum_property_type_to_string to property identify X- parameers
 	and properties.

	* icalparameter.c Fixed icalparameter_as_ical_string to property
 	write out X-Parameters.

	
2000-12-11  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcstp.c added empty bodies to prep_* routines so that shared
 	libraries would build.

2000-12-11  JP Rosevear  <jpr@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icaltime.c (icaltime_compare_date_only): New
	function that compares only the dates, not the times as well.

	* src/libical/icaltime.h: Add prototype for the function above.

	* src/libical/icalrecur.h (struct icalrecurrencetype): Correct
	header documentation.

	* src/libical/icaltypes.c: No longer include <limits.h>.

	* src/libical/icalrecur.c: Likewise.

	* src/libical/icalvalue.c: Likewise.

	* src/libical/icalyacc.y: Likewise.

2000-12-11  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Fixed order of generated files to make
	"make distcheck" work.  Turn on AM_MAINTAINER_MODE.

	* src/libical/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add icalversion.h.in.
	(COMBINEDHEADERS): Added paths to make "make distcheck" work.
	(libical_la_SOURCES): Added headers for distribution in our weird
	setup.

2000-12-06  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaltime.c added icaltime_as_local to convert a UTC time to a
 	local time

	* icaltime.h icaltime.c Removed is_utc argument from
 	icaltime_from_timet

	
2000-11-29  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalrecur.c More testing and bug fixes. Many more of the rules
 	in recur.txt work correctly.

2000-11-28  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalrecur.c Several changes to extract icalrecur.c from
 	libical. I'd like to make it into a reference impl for recurrence
 	rules. CHanges include moving all of the recurrence type and
 	recurrence enums from icalenum and icaltypes into icalrecur, and
 	adding code to parse recurrence rule strings.

	* icaltime.c Changed icaltime_from_string to parse the string
 	directly. Now icaltime.c has no dependency on icalvalue.c

2000-11-21  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalrecur.c Fixed a bug in the increment_* routines that made
 	incrementing by more then 1 insensible. Thanks to Martin Neimeier

2000-11-20  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalmessage.c Many routines to create new ical messages. 

	* icalspanlist.c Code to generate a list of the busy time f the
 	VEVENTS in a set. Also includes routiens to generate free and busy
 	lists from the spanlist, and to find the next free time after a
 	given time.

	* icalvalue.c The STATUS property now has its own value type,
 	STATUS, which holds the enumeration icalproperty_status.

	* icalrestriction.c Added more restrictions. Now handles mutual
 	and exclusive consitions, and checks for the reight values in
 	STATUS properties
	

2000-11-10  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaltypes.c Added routine to create durationtype from string:
 	icaldurationtype_from_string

2000-11-09  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcomponet.c Add sever get/set convienience routines to access
 	and manipulate common component propoerties from the component
 	interface. This eliminates the need to create a lot of temporary
 	variables if you just want to change the start time of and event.

2000-11-06 Eric Busboom    <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcomponent.c Added new routines to icalcomponent:
	_get_span -- returns the start and end times of the event in UTC
	_get_first_real_component -- return ref to VTODO, VEVENT or VJOURNAL

	* icalspanlist.c Added new class, icalspanlist, that generates a
 	list of alternating busy and free times from an icalset. The class
 	includes routines to gnerate rfc2445 busy and free lists, and to
 	get the next available busy or free time after a given time.

2000-11-06  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>
 
	* src/libical/icalvalue.c (icalvalue_recur_as_ical_string): Handle
	both the position and weekday in the by_day field.

2000-10-20  Eric Busboom  <eric@agony.busboom.org>

	* Const correctness. Added 'const' all over everywhere. 

2000-10-19  Eric Busboom  <eric@agony.busboom.org>

	* icalproperty, icalparameter, icalvalue .c, .h Changed most
	instances of char* to const char*

	* icalclassify.h Added multiple include protection

	* icalset.h and others, got rid of parameter named "new"
	
2000-10-15 Eric Busboom   <eric@softwarestudio.org>
	
	* icalcomponent Added convienience functions for constructing
 	components: icalcomponent_new_vcalendar(), etc.

	* Makefile.am Incorporated build system patch from Federico
 	Quintero. Misc small fixes and cleanup

	* scripts Incorporated auto-gen patch from Frederico. Generated
 	code in libical now uses icalproperty.c.in (etc) instead of
 	editing file icalparoperty.c in place.

	* libical. Changed flex/bison to use the -P/-p options to set
 	ical_yy as a prefix. Removed prefix redefinition from icalyacc.y
	
2000-10-12 Eric Busboom    <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalproperty.c Fixed icalproperty_get_{first,next}_parameter to
 	honor the parameter kind argument

	* icalparameter.c Added, but did not complete, a new version of
 	icalparameters_from_string that does not use the hairy nested
 	case/switch statements of the previous version
	
	
2000-10-02 Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* ical.h ical.h and icalss.h now are concatenations of all of the
 	public headers for their respective libraries. Thus, only ical.h,
 	icalss.h and icalvcal.h need to be installed.

2000-09-11  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalvcal.c Added more comments 
	
2000-08-31  JP Rosevear  <jpr@helixcode.com>

	* configure.in: Don't list config.h in AC_OUTPUT
	
2000-08-26  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* examples/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): More `$(srcdir)' loving.

	* src/libicalvcal/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add `-I
	$(srcdir)/../libical' for builddir != srcdir loving.

2000-08-25  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* examples/access_properties_and_parameters.c,
	src/libicalvcal/vcc.y: Got rid of some warnings.

	* src/libicalvcal/vcc.c: Checking in generated C file.

2000-08-25  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalcomponent.c: Fixed an incorrect struct name.

2000-08-25  Peter Williams  <peterw@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalcomponent.c (icalcomponent_end_component): Compile fix;
	use icalerror_check_arg_re so we can return an valid icalcompiter.
	(icalcomponent_begin_component): Same.

2000-08-24  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* src/test/Makefile.am: Make it work.
	
2000-08-04  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* stow.c Changed stow to write data to a file ( icalfileset) not a
 	calendar. Also added MIME parsing capability

	* sspm.c Core of the mime processor. Now handles quoted-printable
 	and base64 encodings

	* icalmime.h New file that parses mime data and returns an
 	icalcomponent that includes all of the parts.

	
2000-07-26   Eric Busboom   <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaldirset.h misc bug fixes to get deleting components to work

	* icalcomponent.h Eliminated internal use of _get_first_component
 	and _get_next_component, since these will reset the interal
 	iterators.

2000-07-23   Eric Busboom   <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcomponent.h Added external iterators to icalcomponent for
 	subcomponents: icalcompiter. These are still experimental, but they
 	seem to work OK and have a nice syntax

2000-07-18   Eric Busboom   <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalset This is a new "superclass" for icalstore, icalcluster,
 	and others. It merges the interfaces of the old icalstore and
 	icalcluster

	* icalstore.{c,h} CHanged name to icaldirset

	* icalcluster.{c,h} Changed name to icalfileset
	

2000-06-12  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalstow.c misc improvements and bug fixes to make it useful.

2000-06-09  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalyacc.y Added support for integers in by day lists

2000-06-01  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalrecur.c moved recur code into new files

2000-05-30  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaltypes.c Extensive work on code to expand recurences

	* icaltypes.h Changed signature icaltimetype_from_timet to include
 	is_utc flag.
	

2000-03-17  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalstore.c Vastly improved icalstore_test. 

2000-03-16  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcluster.c Added compile flag (ICAL_SAFESAVES) to switch how
 	icalcluster saves files during commits. When the flag is define,
 	it will write the data to a temorar file and rename the file to
 	the target file.

	* storage.c Added seterate test suite for sotage components

	* icalparser.c Created parser object, implemented line-oriented
 	parsering, and made message oriented parsing work in terms f line
 	oriented parsing.

	* icalparser.c Fixed icalparser_get_line to remove \r in input.
