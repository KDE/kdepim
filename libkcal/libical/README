LIBICAL -- An implementation of basic iCAL protocols

The code and datafiles in this distribution are licensed under the
Mozilla Public License. See http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/MPL-1.0.html
for a copy of the license. Alternately, you may use libical under the

This dual license ensures that the library can be incorporated into
both proprietary code and GPL'd programs, and will benefit from
improvements made by programmers in both realms. I will only accept
changes into my version of the library if they are similarly
dual-licensed.

The code in this distribution implements the iCal protocols as
described in RFC2445 and RFC2446. The code is in very early stages of
development.

Building the library
--------------------

This distribution is developed on Red Hat Linux 6.0 and usually
compiles on SunOS 5.6 and FreeBSD 2.27. I have reports of success of
previous version on MacOS ( with CodeWarrior ) and on UnixWare, but I
don't know about any other systems.

The library is configured with automake. From the root directory, run 

	./configure

To build all of the Makefiles for your system. If you will be installing the library, you may want to use the --prefix flag to set the directory where the library and header files will be installed. 

	./configure --prefix=/proj/local/

If configure runs fine, run "make" to build the library and 
"make install" to install it.

Although the distribution uses libtool to generate libraries, it has
shared libraries turned off by default. To create and install shared
libraries use:

	./configure --enable-shared

The current version of libical focuses on creating and
manipulating iCal objects. With it, you can parse text representations
of iCal components, add and remove sub-components, properties,
parameters and values, and print the components back out as strings. 


Notes for Libical Developers
-------------------

If you don't want to use gcc as the compiler, and you got the sources
from CVS, you should set the CC variable to the path to the compiler
and run "automake --include-deps" to keep automake from using
gcc-specific automatic dependancy tracking.

        > CC=/pkg/SUNWspro/bin/cc; export CC
        > automake --include-deps
        > ./configure --prefix=/proj/local/
        > make

You will not need to re-run automake unless you got the sources from CVS. 

Using the Library
-----------------

There is rudimentary, unfinished documentation in the /doc directory,
and annotated examples in /examples.


Perl Library
------------

There is a perl language binding of this library, LIBICAL. 
It is  available from http://www.softwarestudio.org/libical
