libkcal
=======

This library contains the calendaring classes originally only used by
KOrganizer. They provide a C++ API for handling the vCalendar and iCalendar
formats, which makes use of Qt classes. This library should be GUI independent
and suitable for writing command line applications.

libkcal is currently only used by KOrganizer. It's API is still under
development and will change without further notice. If you are interested in
using this library, please contact Cornelius Schumacher <schumacher@kde.org>,
the current maintainer of the lib.
