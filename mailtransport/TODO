Mail Transport TODO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General
-------
- use own namespace?
- message sending job classes

Migration
---------
- migration from kmail and knode config files
- password migration within kwallet (for kmail and knode), requires KWallet to
  be fixed first
- convert enum valus (eg '-' is not supported by kcfg)
- reading passwords from config file still using legacy encryption

TransportManager
----------------
- deletetion of Transport objects during reload is a problem
  (create a copy for edit?)
- load passwords if another instance opens the wallet

TransportComboBox
-----------------
- select item by transport id
- handle ad-hoc transports (see identity dialog)
- keep selection on update if possible

TransportConfigDialog
---------------------
- enforce unique name
- Sanity checks as in kmtransport
- adjust port and available auth methods on encryption change
- reset enc/auth selection when host changes

Transport
---------
- fallback to config file password storage
