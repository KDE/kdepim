Mail Transport TODO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General
-------
- use own namespace
- compile with QT_NO_ASCII_CAST and without QT3_SUPPORT
- fix license/copyright, some of the code is taken from KMail/KNode

Migration
---------
- password migration within kwallet (for kmail and knode), requires KWallet to
  be fixed first
- reading passwords from config file still using legacy encryption

TransportManager
----------------
- deletetion of Transport objects during reload is a problem
  (create a copy for edit?)
- load passwords if another instance opens the wallet
- add job scheduler (see knode) for async wallet loading during sending
- migrate passwords to wallet only in one instance

TransportComboBox
-----------------
- select item by transport id
- handle ad-hoc transports (see identity dialog)
- keep selection on update if possible

Transport
---------
- use int for port number instead of QString
- password is not reloaded from wallet on remote change

TransportJob
------------
- use QByteArray for addresses instead of QString
- Transport validity checking

SMTPJob
-------
- get rid of kmail specific stuff in start()
