/**
\brief Checks for support of Non-conflicting edits of Sieve scripts by multiple editors (KEP:14)

\par Introduction

This Kolab Enhancement Proposal defines the conventions and application behaviour to enable
non-conflicting edits of RFC 5228 Sieve scripts on the server by multiple editors.

The result is the ability to have different layers of Sieve management per user, with different
levels of required authorization, and the ability to provide users with multiple active scripts
which can be activated and deactivated as required, thus enabling splitting of the user-facing
Sieve functionality into more conveniently managed files.

Every sieve server can support KEP:14, because it is only a standardisation of filenames and a
way to support and enable mutliple scripts.

For more information on Kolab KEP:14 see:
 * http://wiki.kolab.org/KEP:14
