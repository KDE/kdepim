This is a legacy code to read/write the old vacation scripts for KDE 4 version of kontact.
If once this new version is rolled out, there is no need to keep the legacy way of read/write the vacation script,
because it is not compatible to any other system. The only need to keep this code is for migration old vacation scripts to new one.
