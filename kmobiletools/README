KMobileTools is a KDE application that allows you to control your mobile phone from your GNU/Linux workstation.
All you need to use QTMobileTools is:
	A mobile phone (obiviously), that can be attached to your PC using any type of connection (serial, USB, bluetooth and irda were tested successfully), and using an AT interface (modem-like).
	A GNU/Linux workstation with X and KDE libraries.
	A c++ compiler, system headers and KDE headers, if you want to compile from source code.

If your connection is not serial, you need to convert your mobile phone into a serial device.
For USB devices, you should look for your mobile phone vendor and product id, looking in /proc/bus/usb/devices.
Then run 
	# modprobe usbserial vendor=0xYOURVENDOR product=0xYOURPRODID
to have your mobile phone on /dev/ttyUSB0, or 1, or something similar (look with dmesg if successfully).
Some mobile phone can also be loaded with ACM, that's really easier and gives more performances.

If you have hotplug and ACM module enabled under USB, try simply plugging your device, and do `dmesg | grep ACM` to see where's your mobile phone device.

Actually, this application supports:
	SMS read/write/send/delete.
	Multiple SMS destinations (if supported by the phone).
	Calls handling (dial, answer, close).
	Phonebook reading.
	Last dials, last answered calls and last unanswered calls lists.

Thanks to Il_Tera for the main icon.
