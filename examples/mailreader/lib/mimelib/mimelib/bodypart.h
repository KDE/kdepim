//+ Name DwBodyPart -- Class representing a MIME body-part
//+ Description
//. {\tt DwBodyPart} represents a {\it body part}, as described in RFC-2045
//. and RFC-2046.  A body part is an {\it entity}, so it has a collection
//. of headers and a {\it body}.  A body part is different from a {\it message}
//. in that a body part is part of a multipart body.
//.
//. In MIME++, a {\tt DwBodyPart} is a subclass of {\tt DwEntity}; therefore,
//. it contains both a {\tt DwHeaders} object and a {\tt DwBody} object,
//. and it is contained in a multipart {\tt DwBody} object.
//.
//. As with {\tt DwMessage}, most of the functionality of {\tt DwBodyPart} is
//. implemented by the abstract class {\tt DwEntity}.

    //. The first constructor is the default constructor, which sets the
    //. {\tt DwBodyPart} object's string representation to the empty string
    //. and sets its parent to {\tt NULL}.
    //.
    //. The second constructor is the copy constructor, which performs
    //. a deep copy of {\tt aPart}.
    //. The parent of the new {\tt DwBodyPart} object is set to {\tt NULL}.
    //.
    //. The third constructor copies {\tt aStr} to the {\tt DwBodyPart}
    //. object's string representation and sets {\tt aParent} as its parent.
    //. The virtual member function {\tt Parse()} should be called immediately
    //. after this constructor in order to parse the string representation.
    //. Unless it is {\tt NULL}, {\tt aParent} should point to an object of
    //. a class derived from {\tt DwBody}.

    //. is not changed.

    //. This virtual function, inherited from {\tt DwMessageComponent},
    //. creates a new {\tt DwBodyPart} on the free store that has the same

    //. the user-supplied function pointed to by {\tt sNewBodyPart},
    //. which is assumed to return an object from a class derived from
    //. {\tt DwBodyPart}, and return that object.

    //. object following this {\tt DwBodyPart} in the list of {\tt DwBodyPart}
    //. objects contained in a multipart {\tt DwBody}.  Since {\tt DwBody}
    //. contains a member function for adding a {\tt DwBodyPart} object to
    //. its list, this function should be avoided for most applications.
