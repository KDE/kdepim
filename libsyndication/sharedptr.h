/**
 * A reference-counting pointer.
 *
 * This class serves as a replacement for ordinary C++ pointers, allowing
 * you to handle objects as if they are explicitly shared, handling
 * reference counting behind the scenes.
 *
 * An explicitly shared object provides very cheap copying since only a
 * pointer is copied and a reference count is updated. When an explicitly
 * shared object goes out of scope, the internal reference count gets
 * decreased. The data which multiple explicitly shared objects share is
 * only deleted when the last object which references it goes out of scope.
 *
 * Explicitly shared objects do not provide copy-on-write semantics; this
 * means that changing one object will also change all other objects which
 * share the data. Consider this:
 * \code
 * SharedPtr<QString> w = new QString( "Hello" );
 * SharedPtr<QString> v = w; // Now both v and w say 'Hello'
 * v->clear();                // Clears both v and w!
 * \endcode
 * The last line of code will clear both v and w, since they share the same
 * QString internally. To acquire a copy of the contained object which is
 * independant of all other copies, use the copy() function, as in:
 * \code
 * SharedPtr<QString> w = new QString( "Hello" );
 * SharedPtr<QString> v = w.copy(); // Make v a detached copy of w
 * v->clear();                       // v is cleared, w still says 'Hello'
 * \endcode
