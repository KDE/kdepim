/**
 * This class is the preferred way of loading feed sources. Usage is very
 * straightforward:
 *
 * \code
 * Loader *loader = Loader::create();
 * connect(loader, SIGNAL(loadingComplete(Loader*, FeedPtr, ErrorCode)),
 *         this, SLOT(slotLoadingComplete(Loader*, FeedPtr, ErrorCode)));
 * loader->loadFrom("http://www.blah.org/foobar.rdf");
 * \endcode
 *
 * This creates a Loader object, connects it's loadingComplete() signal to
 * your custom slot and then makes it load the file
 * 'http://www.blah.org/foobar.rdf'. You could've
 * done something like this as well:
 *
 * \code
 * // create the Loader, connect it's signal...
 * loader->loadFrom("/home/myself/some-script.py", new OutputRetriever);
 * \endcode
 *
 * That'd make the Loader use a custom algorithm for retrieving the RSS data;
 * 'OutputRetriever' will make it execute the script
 * '/home/myself/some-script.py' and assume whatever that script prints to
 * stdout is RSS/Azom markup. This is e.g. handy for conversion scripts, which
 * download a HTML file and convert it's contents into RSS markup.
 *
 * No matter what kind of retrieval algorithm you employ, your
 * 'slotLoadingComplete' method might look like this:
 *
 * \code
 * void MyClass::slotLoadingComplete(Loader* loader, FeedPtr feed, ErrorCode status)
 * {
 *     // Note that Loader::~Loader() is private, so you cannot delete Loader instances.
 *     // You don't need to do that anyway since Loader instances delete themselves.
 *
 *     if (status != Syndication::Success)
 *         return;
 *
 *     QString title = feed->title();
 *     // do whatever you want with the information.
 * }
 * \endcode
