* Add quoted-printable and base64 encoding + decoding.
  - existing, public domain code can be used (it exists) or a new
    implementation can be written if in the mood.

* Implementing parsing of 'group'
  - A 'Group' is a special kind of address. An 'Address' may be
    either a Mailbox or a Group. See RFC822 for details.

* Make it easier to construct messages.

* Nail down the parsing of mime bodies, which is a little buggy.
