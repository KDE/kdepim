* Add quoted-printable and base64 encoding + decoding.
  - existing, public domain code can be used (it exists) or a new
    implementation can be written if in the mood.
  - The code that we have is funkarific.  It can't even decode what it
    encoded itself!  I would recommend testing with a postscript file.
    It's binary, but it's ascii enough to be readable (diff -a)

* Implementing parsing of 'group'
  - A 'Group' is a special kind of address. An 'Address' may be
    either a Mailbox or a Group. See RFC822 for details.
    (Note: All necessary RFCs can be found here:
     http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/information/rfc.html)

* Make it easier to construct messages.

* Nail down the parsing of mime bodies, which is a little buggy.
