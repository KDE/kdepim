<h1>
Introduction</h1>
Entries in KDE address databases are stored in key-value-pairs with different
data types. Every part of an address or personal in general is mapped to
such a key-value-pair. For inter-application portability, the valid keys
in such a key-value-map need to be defined. This page gives an overview
over all field names and types used by KDE address book entries:

The following notes should guide through the columns of the table.
<h1>
Field Key</h1>
The field key is used to find the value. Thus, it needs to be identifying.
In every entry, all keys may be inserted only one time (in STL terms, the
entries are maps, not sets). As a guideline, all valid C++ identifiers
may be used as field keys.
<h1>
Literal field Name</h1>
This values have been defined to make sure each application uses the same
names for different fields. This should make it easier for the applications
users to find what they look for.
<h1>
Some Notes</h1>
This notes might be removed after the field names are standardized.
<h2>
Number of Addresses</h2>
In this overview, the number of addresses is no more fixed by a special
value (like MAX_ADDRESSES in the former class "Entry"). There are simply
(currently) 3 fields named X-Street_1, X-Street_2, and X-Street_3.
<br>Also, addresses, by now, do not have types like business, home, or
other. It would probably be a good idea to give some patterns when entering
the headline, but allow the user to select other names, too. This way addresses
may be sorted in other categories than the programmer is able to anticipate
:-)
<h2>
Telephone Numbers</h2>
I would opt for the following way to store telephone (and related) numbers:
<ul>
<li>
Define the types, for example, "Home", "Cellular", "Fax", "Other".</li>

<li>
Store each number as a combination of type and number. Could be done as
a string, like "FAX: 0123456789".</li>
</ul>
The apps would have to parse this and find the type.
<h2>
The very special Fields</h2>
It is a matter of agreement what fields are declared to be a standard and
what would be application-specific extensions.
<br>I chose it the following way: Everything that is part of the persons
attributes and that we already thought of is a standard field, and everything
completely unusable by other applications must be an application-specific
extension.
<br>The reason is explainable by the following examples:
<ul>
<li>
The rank field is very special. But if two applications A-Book and B-Book
store the rank of a person, it would be nonsense if one stores "A-Book-Rank",
and the other reads "B-Book-Rank".</li>

<li>
Consider the pilot conduit interfacing the addressbook applications to
the pilots addressbook. Here, "Pilot-Conduit-EntryID" would not make any
sense to A-Book or B-Book. This is definitly application specific.</li>
</ul>
As a consequence, we will have to add more attributes that we currently
not think of later. But this should be no problem.
