This is the README for the mimelib library, which is based on the mimepp library
by Doug Sauder <dwsauder@fwb.gulf.net>. Since KDE uses a slightly patched
version of mimepp, the author and the KDE Team agreed, that we rename it for
use in KDE. But please report bugs, that you find in the code to Doug, since
he still maintains the code.
