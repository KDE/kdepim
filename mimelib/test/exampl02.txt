Dear Forgetful:

Rush to your terminal right away and post an article that says, "Oops, I
forgot to post my signature with that last article. Here it is."

Since most people will have forgotten your earlier article, (particularly
since it dared to be so boring as to not have a nice, juicy signature) this
will remind them of it. Besides, people care much more about the signature
anyway. See the previous letter for more important details.

Also, be sure to include your signature TWICE in each article. That way
you're sure people will read it.

Em
