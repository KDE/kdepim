Dear Eager:

No problem, just post your message to a group that a lot of people read.
Say, "This is for John Smith. I couldn't get mail through so I'm posting it.
All others please ignore."

This way tens of thousands of people will spend a few seconds scanning over
and ignoring your article, using up over 16 man-hours of their collective
time, but you will be saved the terrible trouble of checking through usenet
maps or looking for alternate routes. Just think, if you couldn't distribute
your message to 9000 other computers, you might actually have to (gasp) call
directory assistance for 60 cents, or even phone the person. This can cost
as much as a few DOLLARS (!) for a 5 minute call!

And certainly it's better to spend 10 to 20 dollars of other people's money
distributing the message than for you to have to waste $9 on an overnight
letter, or even 29 cents on a stamp!

Don't forget. The world will end if your message doesn't get through, so
post it as many places as you can.

Em
