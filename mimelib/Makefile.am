# UNIX makefile for MIME++ library and example programs

# Choose a version to compile.  I recommend compiling development version,
# which includes numerous assert macros to catch bad function arguments
# and other safeguards.  The production version is designed to avoid
# program aborts, such as will occur if an assertion fails.  The production
# version tries to recover as best it can in the case of exceptional
# conditions.  The debug version is designed to help you find bugs once
# you know they exist.  The development version helps you out here just
# a little, because it will dump core so you can examine the program
# state with a debugger.
#
# Make sure you type 'make clean' after compiling one version before
# compiling a different version.
