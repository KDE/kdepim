//+ Name DwHeaders -- Class representing the collection of header fields in a message or body part
//+ Description
//. {\tt DwHeaders} represents the collection of {\it header fields} (often
//. called just {\it headers}) in an {\it entity} (either a message or body
//. part), as described in RFC-822 and RFC-2045.  A {\tt DwHeaders} object
//. manages a list of {\tt DwField} objects, which represent the individual
//. header fields.
//.
//. In the tree (broken-down) representation of a message, a {\tt DwHeaders}
//. object is an intermediate node, having both a parent node and several
//. child nodes.  The parent node is the {\tt DwEntity} object that contains
//. it.  The child nodes are the {\tt DwField} objects in the list it manages.
//. (See the man page for {\tt DwMessageComponent} for a discussion of
//. the tree representation of a message.)
//.
//. Normally, you do not create a {\tt DwHeaders} object directly, but you
//. access it through the {\tt Headers()} member function of {\tt DwEntity},
//. which creates the {\tt DwHeaders} object for you.
//.
//. While {\tt DwHeaders} has public member functions for managing the list
//. of {\tt DwField} objects it contains, you will normally use convenience
//. functions to access the field bodies of the header fields directly.
//. You can access the field body for a specific well-known header field
//. by using the member function {\tt <Field>()}, where {\tt <Field>} is
//. the field name of the header field with hyphens removed and the first
//. word following a hyphen capitalized.  For example, to access the field
//. body for the "MIME-version" header field, use {\tt MimeVersion()}.
//. The member function {\tt <Field>()} will create a header field with
//. field name {\tt <Field>} if such a header field does not already exist.
//. You can check for the existence of a particular well-known header field
//. by using the member function {\tt Has<Field>()}.  For example, to check
//. for the existence of the MIME-version header field, use
//. {\tt HasMimeVersion()}.  Well-known header fields are those documented in
//. RFC-822 (standard email), RFC-1036 (USENET messages), RFC-2045 (MIME
//. messages), and possibly other RFCs.
//.
//. In the case of an extension field or user-defined field, you can access
//. the field body of the header field by calling the member function
//. {\tt FieldBody()} with the field name as its argument.  If the extension
//. field or user-defined field does not exist, {\tt FieldBody()} will
//. create it.  You can check for the existence of an extension field or
//. user-defined field by using the member function {\tt HasField()} with
//. the field name as its argument.
//.
//. {\tt DwHeaders} has several other member functions provided for the
//. sake of completeness that are not required for most applications.
//. These functions are documented below.

public:

    DwHeaders();
    DwHeaders(const DwHeaders& aHeaders);
    DwHeaders(const DwString& aStr, DwMessageComponent* aParent=0);
    //. The first constructor is the default constructor, which sets the
    //. {\tt DwHeaders} object's string representation to the empty string
    //. and sets its parent to {\tt NULL}.
    //.
    //. The second constructor is the copy constructor, which performs a
    //. deep copy of {\tt aHeaders}.
    //. The parent of the new {\tt DwHeaders} object is set to {\tt NULL}.
    //.
    //. The third constructor copies {\tt aStr} to the {\tt DwHeaders}
    //. object's string representation and sets {\tt aParent} as its parent.
    //. The virtual member function {\tt Parse()} should be called immediately
    //. after this constructor in order to parse the string representation.
    //. Unless it is {\tt NULL}, {\tt aParent} should point to an object of a class
    //. derived from {\tt DwEntity}.

    virtual ~DwHeaders();

    const DwHeaders& operator = (const DwHeaders& aHeaders);
    //. This is the assignment operator, which performs a deep copy of
    //. {\tt aHeaders}.  The parent node of the {\tt DwHeaders} object
    //. is not changed.

    virtual void Parse();
    //. This virtual function, inherited from {\tt DwMessageComponent},
    //. executes the parse method for {\tt DwHeaders} objects.  The parse
    //. method creates or updates the broken-down representation from the
    //. string representation.  For {\tt DwHeaders} objects,
    //. {\tt DwHeaders::Parse()} parses the string representation to create
    //. a list of {\tt DwField} objects.  This member function also calls
    //. the {\tt Parse()} member function of each {\tt DwField} object in
    //. its list.
    //.
    //. You should call this member function after you set or modify the
    //. string representation, and before you access any of the header fields.
    //.
    //. This function clears the is-modified flag.

    virtual void Assemble();
    //. This virtual function, inherited from {\tt DwMessageComponent},
    //. executes the assemble method for {\tt DwHeaders} objects.  The
    //. assemble method creates or updates the string representation from
    //. the broken-down representation.  That is, the assemble method
    //. builds the string representation from its list of {\tt DwField}
    //. objects.  Before it builds the string representation, this function
    //. first calls the {\tt Assemble()} member function of each {\tt DwField}
    //. object in its list.
    //.
    //. You should call this member function after you set or modify any
    //. of the header fields, and before you retrieve the string
    //. representation.
    //.
    //. This function clears the is-modified flag.

    virtual DwMessageComponent* Clone() const;
    //. This virtual function, inherited from {\tt DwMessageComponent},
    //. creates a new {\tt DwHeaders} on the free store that has the same
    //. value as this {\tt DwHeaders} object.  The basic idea is that of
    //. a virtual copy constructor.
