//=============================================================================
//+ Name DwAddress -- Abstract class representing an RFC-822 address
//+ Description
//. {\tt DwAddress} represents an {\it address} as described in RFC-822.
//. You may not instantiate objects of type {\tt DwAddress}, since
//. {\tt DwAddress} is an abstract base class.  Instead, you must instantiate
//. objects of type {\tt DwMailbox} or {\tt DwGroup}, which are subclasses
//. of {\tt DwAddress}.
//.
//. To determine the actual type of a {\tt DwAddress} object, you can use
//. the member functions {\tt IsMailbox()} and {\tt IsGroup()}.
//.
//. If the string representation assigned to a {\tt DwAddress} is improperly
//. formed, the parse method will fail.  To determine if the parse method
//. failed, call the member function {\tt IsValid()}.
//.
//. A {\tt DwAddress} object can be contained in list.  To get the next
//. {\tt DwAddress} object in the list, call the member function {\tt Next()}.
//=============================================================================

    DwAddress* Next() const;

    //. is included in a list of addresses.  The function is used when
    //. iterating a list.

    //. The third constructor copies {\tt aStr} to the {\tt DwAddress}

    //. The virtual member function {\tt Parse()} should be called immediately
    //. after this constructor in order to parse the string representation.
