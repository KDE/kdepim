//+ Name DwString -- String class
//+ Description
//. {\tt DwString} is the workhorse of the MIME++ library.  Creating, parsing,
//. or otherwise manipulating MIME messages is basically a matter of
//. manipulating strings.  {\tt DwString} provides all the basic functionality
//. required of a string object, including copying, comparing, concatenating,
//. and so on.
//.
//. {\tt DwString} is similar to the {\tt string} class that is part of
//. the proposed ANSI standard C++ library.  Some of the member functions
//. present in the ANSI {\tt string} are not present in {\tt DwString}:
//. mostly these are the functions that deal with iterators.  {\tt DwString}
//. also includes some member functions and class utility functions that
//. are not a part of the ANSI {\tt string} class.  These non-ANSI
//. functions are easy to distinguish: they all begin with upper-case
//. letters, and all ANSI functions begin with lower-case letters.  The
//. library classes themselves use only the ANSI {\tt string} functions.
//. At some point in the future, MIME++ will probably allow the option to
//. substitute the ANSI {\tt string} class for {\tt DwString}.
//.
//. {\tt DwString} makes extensive use of copy-on-write, even when extracting
//. substrings.  It is this feature that distiguishes {\tt DwString} from most
//. other string classes.  {\tt DwString} also handles binary data, which can
//. contain embedded NUL characters.

    DwString(char* aBuf, size_t aSize, size_t aStart, size_t aLen);
    //. The first constructor is the default constructor, which sets the
    //. {\tt DwString} object's contents to be empty.
    //.
    //. The second constructor is the copy constructor, which copies at most
    //. {\tt aLen} characters beginning at position
    //. {\tt aPos} from {\tt aStr} to the new {\tt DwString} object.  It will
    //. not copy more characters than what are available in {\tt aStr}.
    //. {\tt aPos} must be less than or equal to {\tt aStr.size()}.
    //.
    //. The third constructor copies {\tt aLen} characters from the buffer
    //. {\tt aBuf} into the new {\tt DwString} object. {\tt aBuf} need not be
    //. NUL-terminated and may contain NUL characters.
    //.
    //. The fourth constructor copies the contents of the NUL-terminated string
    //. {\tt aCstr} into the new {\tt DwString} object.
    //.
    //. The fifth constructor sets the contents of the new {\tt DwString}
    //. object to be the character {\tt aChar} repeated {\tt aLen} times.
    //.
    //. The sixth constructor is an {\it advanced} constructor that sets
    //. the contents of the new {\tt DwString} object to the {\tt aLen}
    //. characters starting at offset {\tt aStart} in the buffer {\tt aBuf}.
    //. {\tt aSize} is the allocated size of {\tt aBuf}.
    //. This constructor is provided for efficiency in setting a new
    //. {\tt DwString}'s contents from a large buffer.  It is efficient
    //. because no copying takes place.  Instead, {\tt aBuf} becomes the
    //. buffer used internally by the {\tt DwString} object, which
    //. takes responsibility for deleting the buffer.
    //. Because {\tt DwString} will free the buffer using {\tt delete []},
    //. the buffer should have been allocated using {\tt new}.
    //. See also: TakeBuffer(), and ReleaseBuffer().

    //. Note, however, that because of the copy-on-modify feature of

    //. ownership of its internal buffer.  When that is case,

    //. On return from this member function, the {\tt DwString} object will
