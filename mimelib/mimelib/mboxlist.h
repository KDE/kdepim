//+ Name DwMailboxList -- Class representing a list of RFC-822 mailboxes
//+ Description
//. {\tt DwMailboxList} represents a list of {\it mailboxes} as described
//. in RFC-822.  In MIME++, {\tt DwMailboxList} is a container for objects
//. of type {\tt DwMailbox}, and it contains various member functions to
//. manage its contained objects.  {\tt DwAddressList} is also a
//. {\tt DwFieldBody}.  This reflects the fact that certain RFC-822 header
//. fields, such as the "From" header field, have a list of mailboxes as
//. their field bodies.

    DwMailboxList();
    DwMailboxList(const DwMailboxList& aList);
    DwMailboxList(const DwString& aStr, DwMessageComponent* aParent=0);
    //. The first constructor is the default constructor, which sets the
    //. {\tt DwMailboxList} object's string representation to the empty string
    //. and sets its parent to {\tt NULL}.
    //.
    //. The second constructor is the copy constructor, which copies the
    //. string representation and all {\tt DwMailbox} objects from {\tt aList}.
    //. The parent of the new {\tt DwMailboxList} object is set to {\tt NULL}.
    //.
    //. The third constructor copies {\tt aStr} to the {\tt DwMailboxList}
    //. object's string representation and sets {\tt aParent} as its parent.
    //. The virtual member function {\tt Parse()} should be called immediately
    //. after this constructor in order to parse the string representation.
    //. Unless it is {\tt NULL}, {\tt aParent} should point to an object of
    //. a class derived from {\tt DwField}.

    virtual ~DwMailboxList();

    const DwMailboxList& operator = (const DwMailboxList& aList);
    //. This is the assignment operator, which performs a deep copy of
    //. {\tt aList}.  The parent node of the {\tt DwMailboxList} object
    //. is not changed.

    virtual void Parse();
    //. This virtual function, inherited from {\tt DwMessageComponent},
    //. executes the parse method for {\tt DwMailboxList} objects. The parse
    //. method creates or updates the broken-down representation from the
    //. string representation.  For {\tt DwMailboxList} objects, the parse
    //. method parses the string representation to create a list of
    //. {\tt DwMailbox} objects.  This member function also calls the
    //. {\tt Parse()} member function of each {\tt DwMailbox} object in
    //. its list.
    //.
    //. You should call this member function after you set or modify the
    //. string representation, and before you access any of the contained
    //. {\tt DwMailbox} objects.
    //.
    //. This function clears the is-modified flag.

    virtual void Assemble();
    //. This virtual function, inherited from {\tt DwMessageComponent},
    //. executes the assemble method for {\tt DwMailboxList} objects. The
    //. assemble method creates or updates the string representation from
    //. the broken-down representation.  For {\tt DwMailboxList} objects,
    //. the assemble method builds the string representation from its list
    //. of {\tt DwMailbox} objects. Before it builds the string representation
    //. for the {\tt DwMailboxList} object, this function first calls the
    //. {\tt Assemble()} member function of each {\tt DwMailbox} object
    //. in its list.
    //.
    //. You should call this member function after you set or modify any
    //. of the contained {\tt DwMailbox} objects, and before you retrieve
    //. the string representation.
    //.
    //. This function clears the is-modified flag.

    virtual DwMessageComponent* Clone() const;
    //. This virtual function, inherited from {\tt DwMessageComponent},
    //. creates a new {\tt DwMailboxList} on the free store that has the same
    //. value as this {\tt DwMailboxList} object.  The basic idea is that of
    //. a virtual copy constructor.

    DwMailbox* FirstMailbox() const;
    //. Gets the first {\tt DwMailbox} object in the list.
    //. Use the member function {\tt DwMailbox::Next()} to iterate.
    //. Returns {\tt NULL} if the list is empty.

    //. Adds {\tt aMailbox} to the end of the list of {\tt DwMailbox} objects
    //. maintained by this {\tt DwMailboxList} object.

    void Remove(DwMailbox* aMailbox);
    //. Removes {\tt aMailbox} from the list of {\tt DwMailbox} objects
    //. maintained by this {\tt DwMailboxList} object.  The {\tt DwMailbox}
    //. object is not deleted by this member function.

    //. maintained by this {\tt DwMailboxList} object.

    //. Creates a new {\tt DwMailboxList} object on the free store.
    //. If the static data member {\tt sNewMailboxList} is {\tt NULL},
    //. this member function will create a new {\tt DwMailboxList}
    //. and return it.  Otherwise, {\tt NewMailboxList()} will call
    //. the user-supplied function pointed to by {\tt sNewMailboxList},
    //. which is assumed to return an object from a class derived from
    //. {\tt DwMailboxList}, and return that object.

    //. derived from {\tt DwMailboxList}.

    void _AddMailbox(DwMailbox* aMailbox);

    void _DeleteAll();
