  API REVIEW of the ManipulatorPart
  ConvienceLibrary for what is shared
  Debug
  
Syncing:
    A supports full iCal for Example
    B supports only little of it
    B was changed currently we would loose
    extra attributes of A
    
    Two ways of solving them
    a)
	merge B with A before replacing.
	This means all empty fields of B
	will be merged with A.
	Problem empty fields on purpose will
	be overwritten
    b)  A support map inside the Syncee
	so that replaceEntry can see what is supported
	and can do a clever 'merge'
	This would be implementation detail of the
	Syncee..
	
   I'm for b!
