          were inadvertently changed from "Pilot" to "Palm" during one of
          the source cleanup passes (pback did, and still does, work with a
          ~/Pilot directory, but several of the comments were changed to
          refer to a non-existent Palm directory). (Carl Jacobsen)

	* scripts/todolist.pl: Add a "-N" option to display notes attached
	  to ToDo entries, and clean up the usage statement just a bit.

May 10, 1999    Tilo Christ             0.9.3

        Fixed Win32 support.

        Applied patch by John Franks to inet.c

Apr 26, 1999	Kenneth Albanowski	0.9.3

	Upgrade configure to use autoconf 2.13.
	
	Installed the rest of Tilo's patches.

Apr  4, 1999	Kenneth Albanowski	0.9.2

	Please note a significant (but minor) change: the license for the hinote
	code in the pisock library has been changed to LGPL. In the previous
	release (0.9.1), it was GPL, which would prevent the library from being
	used in an LGPL manner. If you wish to use the pisock library with the
	LGPL license, please base your work on 0.9.2.

	Rewrote pilot-dedupe in a more sensible manner. (New version could have
	some bugs.)
	
	Added Tilo's changes to support "high" baud rates with PILOTRATE
	environment variable.  Say "PILOTRATE=H115200" to specify a high rate.
	PILOTHIGHRATE variable is now ignored.
	
	Added Tilo's pi_setmaxspeed() function, and added initial
	pi_getsockopt() support to retrieve current speed.
	
	Changed Python detection to support 1.5.1 installation.

Jan 14,	1999	Kenneth Albanowski	0.9.1

	Hi-Notes support (in 'hinotes' and 'install-hinote', courtesy of Bill
	Goodman, and Michael Bravo.)
	
	Install-memo improvements.
	
	read-ical improvements (?) regarding secret records and alarms.
	
	Fixed pi-getrom's decoding of ROM version. (3.0 units should now
	download complete ROM image.)
	
	Installation of databases fixed to allow uploading of databases with
	zero-length resources.
	
	Direct support for "high" (nominally unsupported) baud rates via
	PILOTHIGHRATE environment variable.

Aug 23,  1998	Kenneth Albanowski	0.9.0

	Please note a significant change: the license for the pisock library,
	the C++ libary, and the Perl, Python, Tcl, and Java bindings has been
	changed from the GPL (GNU Public License) to the LGPL (Library GNU
	Public License). For more information, please see the files COPYING.LIB,
	and COPYING.
	
	If you have any reason to disagree with this change, please contact me
	as soon as possible. I have attempted to verify with all affected
	parties that this change is acceptable.
	
	This license change applies starting with release 0.9.0 of pilot-link. 
	This change is not retroactive, and previous releases (0.8.13, and
	before) are still available, with all parts under the GPL.
	
In other news:
	
	pi-getrom fixed to get 2 Meg of ROM on a 3.0 device (by working around a
	bug in PalmOS 3.0.)
	
	read-todos modified to work with both a ToDoDB.pdb file (as downloaded
	from the device), as well as the database on the device.
	
	Tcl binding changed to remove "Pilot" from name. (I'm only changing Tcl
	at the moment, because nothing could possibly be relying on it.)

May 11,  1998	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.13

	This version is an unchanged re-release of 0.8.12, which was not
	released properly. (0.8.12 archives actually contain 0.8.11, mea culpa.)

May  7,  1998	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.12

	Not much work has gone into pilot-link since the previous release, the
	main changes being several patches that have been applied:

	David Warren's <dsw@comfortably-numb.engr.sgi.com> fix for reminds.c.

	Dag Nygren's <dag@newtech.fi> tickles for sync-plan.

	Russell Nelson's <nelson@crynwr.com> patches for pilot-mail.

	Bodo Bellut's <bodo@garfield.ping.de> patch for pi-file to better catch
	errors.
 
	Jay Sekora's <js@aq.org> improved memos and pilot-addresses.
	
	Rik Harris's <Rik.Harris@fulcrum.com.au> patch to get pi-port working.
	
	Fixed libsock/socket.c to not crash on unbound/unconnected socket.	
	
	Added Rui Oliveira's <rco@di.uminho.pt> MoneyManager code.
	
	Removed Java bin build directory stuff, it was broken.

	Also, I've decided that getopt() was a complete loss where pilot-xfer is
	concerned, so it now has manual argument processing. I rather expect the
	new code is buggy, too, but at least it will be the same bugs for
	everyone.
	
	Lastly, I've added the latest release of libtool, 1.2. This should fix
	some problems, but might well cause others. Let me know, of course.

Feb 27,  1998	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.11

	Sorry, no time for detail:
	
	  - Java build changed, to store executables in separate directory
	  - Minor patch to Perl binding
	  - Major patch to Python binding
	  - A few OS/2 improvements
	  
	  Note: I've seen an apparent problem with glibc2's getopt, but this
	        is not confirmed.

Dec 20,  1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.10
	Library changes:
	  - Bug affecting address book sorting corrected
	Utility changes:
	  - pilot-xfer mistake corrected (-b acted like -u).

Dec 14,  1997	Kenenth Albanowski 0.8.9
	Configuration changed:
	  - added Python configuration patches by Bill Janssen
	    <janssen@parc.xerox.com>.

	  - added GNU (glibc2) getopt, changed pilot-xfer to use long options.
	  - install-memos getopt tweak
	  - added patches by Jay Sekora <js@aq.org> to improve memos
	  - added Ian Goldberg's sensible name escape patches for pilot-xfer
	    (so that a database with a slash or equals in the name is translated
	    to something safe.)
	  - added slightly modified patches by Simon Burge
	    <simonb@telstra.com.au> so that pilot-xfer does not have to back
	    up the entire Pilot each time. (added sync and update modes).

Dec  7,  1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.8
	Configuration changes:
	  - add sa_len member to pi_sockaddr, to match OS
	  - include compatability code for putenv
	Library changes:
	  - Modified PADP code to better cope with the timeout response of
	    PalmOS 2.0. (The result is _not_ faster response, but less
	    confusion.)
	Utility changes:
	  - pilot-debug has minimal feature support
	  - install-memo has several new options, provided by Paul Traina
	    <pst@Shockwave.COM>.

Oct  7,  1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.7
	Configuration changes:
	  - install .hxx headers
	  - use $(MAKE) instead of make
	  - added latest libtool-1.0c
	Utility changes:
	  - pi-nredir deals with missing putenv or setenv
	Perl 5 binding changes:
	  - quote "index".
	  - change usages of errno as a member to errnop

Sep  14, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.6
	Configuration changes:
	  - skip sys/select.h if it is not available
	Utility changes:
	  - added pi-getram utility to fetch RAM image. (Use -c switch if fetching for Copilot).
	  - added holey files to pi-getrom
	All:
	  - corrected miscellaneous C warnings
	Documentation changes:
	  - added program list to README

Sep  6, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.5
	Configuration changes:
	  - added patch for libtool 1.0b to prevent extraneous 'n's.
	Utility changes:
	  - pilot-debug adjusted for release version of Tcl 8.0.
	  - sync-plan massively updated to support syncing multiple plan
	    database against a single Pilot, support for more then one Pilot,
	    working repetitions, general bug fixes, etc.
	Perl 5 binding changes:
	  - Several bug fixes by Bharat.

Aug 31, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.4
	Configuration changes:
	  - libtool 1.0b included (which means you can say './libtool gdb pilot-mail')
	  - 'dubious' directory added
	Utility changes:
	  - Added sync-plan module to do complete Pilot<->Plan synchronization.
	Perl 5 binding changes:
	  - Several bug fixes by Bharat.

Aug 24, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.3
	Perl 5 binding changes:
	  - Default attributes of new records.
	  - Generic typedef for all pilot-link char* casts.
	  - Added SvOK and SvTYPE checks to all (?) SvRV extactions.
	  - Rewrote unpacking technique to deal with failed unpackings (due
	    to deleted records.)
	  - Rewrote packing technique to deal with deleted records (produce
	    empty result).
	  - alarm->units returns text, not numbes.
	  - Fixed shadowing variable in getNextModRecord.

Aug 17, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.2
	Utility changes:
	  - read-ical: still more oops.
	  - pi-csd: scrap ifr_netmask.

Aug 9, 1997		Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.1
	Configuration changes:
	  - A few tweaks for Java and OS/2.
	Pisocket library changes:
	  - For datebook packer code: repeatOn split into repeatDay and repeatDays.
	  - Fixed pi-file crash on records larger then 64K. (Note that the Pilot
	    itself cannot deal with records larger then 64K!)
	  - pi-csd now tries to cope better with missing ifr_netmask.
	  - pi-nredir: setenv scrapped.
	  - pilot-mail: Added x-mailer header, and avoid preprending dashes to
	    signature if it already has them.
	  - pilot-xfer: tried to fix optind. Again.
	  - read-ical: oops.
	Utility changes:
	  - Added installdatebook and ietf2datebook, both provided by Tero
	    Kivinen <kivinen@ssh.fi>
	Java binding changes:
	  - Now compiles with JDK 1.1.
	  - All standard Pilot databases support with complete packer/unpacker
	    support.
	  - File access added.
	  - All enumeration record values changed over to enumeration objects.
	  - All bit-fields replaced with individual items.
	Perl 5 binding changes:
	  - All enumeration record values changed over to text values.
	  - Support for mail preferences added.
	  - Expense database supported.
	  - All bit-fields replaced with individual items.
	  - Open command accepts text mode ("rxws") as well as numeric.
	Python binding changes:
	  - All enumeration record values changed over to text values.

Aug 4, 1997 	Kenneth Albanowski 0.8.0

	Configuration changes:
	  - Added dependancy checking to utilties.
	  - Touched up OS/2 configuration slightly.
	  - Added detection of uname and other SunOS (or was it Solaris?) foibles.
	Pisocket library changes:
	  - Changes to nearly all structure definitions, though these are mostly
	    just changes to the names of members. The names have been changed to
	    follow a common naming scheme ("thisIsAMethod", "ramSize", etc.),
	    to remove chopped words, and to let the interpreter bindings use the
	    same member names as the C code. The new names are frozen (I hope)
	    and will not change again.
	  - Category information has been broken out of the appInfo structures
	    into a separate structure, since it was producing needless
	    duplicated code.
	  - All of the database record packing code had been tuned and tested,
	    and now pay attention to their arguments. In particular, both the
	    packers and unpackers return how many bytes were used (or zero if
	    the buffer wasn't long enough), and the packer will return the
	    desired buffer length if it is passed a buffer address of zero. 
	    These changes allow programs to let the packer calculate how much
	    buffer space should be allocated.
	  - Version number of shared library bumped up to indicate incompatible changes.
	Test code changes:
	  - Added test code to check all packers and unpackers for proper operation.
	Utility changes:
	  - Added pi-getrom program to fetch a Pilot's ROM through RPC calls.
	    Be careful, this program _could_ cause your Pilot to lock up, so
	    back up first. But I'd love to hear about any problems.
	  - pi-csd tries to get the host name via uname if gethostname isn't available.
	  - Added backlight support to remote UI in pilot-debug.
	  - Added Ian G.'s pilot-debug patches to support pasting text into the remote UI.
	  - All utilities modified to match changes to pisocket library.
	Java binding changes:
	  - Dlp exceptions now contain (through hard effort) the Dlp error value
	  - Use slightly less deprecated Date interface (bleagh!)
	  - Structures modified to match new definitions.
	  - Added resetNext & callApplication methods.
	  - Adapted packers to new structures -- broke off categories into
	    a subclass of AppBlock.
	  - Added support for all standard databases except Expense.
	  - Changed toString mechanism to allow superclasses to build up description.
	  - Added newRecord, newResource, newAppBlock, newSortBlock and newPref methods.
	  - Java structures and methods are freezing if not frozen.
	Perl 5 binding changes:
	  - Structures modified to match new definitions.
	  - Perl structures and methods are freezing if not frozen.
	  - Renamed methods to match Java binding ("likeThis", "ramSize", "getRecord", etc.)
	Python binding changes:
	  - Structures modified to match new definitions.
	  - Python structures and methods are freezing if not frozen.
	  - Renamed methods to match Java binding.
	

Jul 26, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.7.6

	Configuration changes:
	  - No more complaints if the Java Development Kit isn't installed.
	  - sockaddr.sa_len member is detected (for pi-csd)
	Pisocket library changes:
	  - Support for Palm's TCP/IP NetSync(tm) has been added. To use this,
	    give a program like pilot-xfer a port of '.' (a single period). You
	    will also need to run (perhaps in the background) pi-csd, with its
	    settings configured to match the PC NetSync(tm) settings on your
	    PalmPilot(tm).
	  - Leak of laddr/raddr members fixed.
	Utility changes:
	  - Added pi-csd program to allow network synchronization. This program
	    must be running for your computer to accept NetSync(tm) connections
	    from a PalmPilot(tm). You must of course also run whatever utility
	    or synchronization program you want the PalmPilot(tm) to connect to.
	  - Added pi-nredir to allow a normal (or network, for that matter)
	    connection to be redirected over the network to pilot-link or the
	    PalmPilot(tm) Desktop.
	  - Read-ical patches by Ian G. applied, allowing use of a default port,
	    and a method of hiding the text of datebook entries.
	Java binding changes:
	  - Todo application supported.
	  - You can now open a database using an instance of Pdapilot.Database
	    instead of a database name.

Jul 22, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.7.5

	Configuration changes:
	  - Uninstalled binaries should better cope with symlinks or moving
	    their directory.
	  - The Java Development Kit is automatically detected.
	Build changes:
	  - Man pages probably can be installed now
	  - Added Mike Jarabek's latest OS/2 patches, which should allow a
	    shared libpisock dll to be built and used.
	Pisoket library changes:
	  - Mail preferences renamed from "MailPrefs" to "MailPref1".
	  - Corrected bug in retrieving NetSync info if fields were empty.
	Utility changes:
	  - Modified pilot-undelete slightly to match new Perl5 module.
	  - Added pilot-xfer patches (slightly modified) by Christopher Chan-Nui
	    <channui@austin.ibm.com>. These allow default port via PILOTPORT,
	    and multiple files/db's with a command.
	Java binding changes:
	  - New! All of the libpisock functionality is accessible from the Java
	    interpreter. The only missing parts are RPC, CallApplication, and
	    the packers other then Memo.
	Perl 5 binding changes:
	  - Completely revised record storage mechanism uses objects to describe
	    records, resources, appblocks, sortblocks, and prefs.
	    All current code using the Perl5 module will need to be rewritten,
	    though the changes will probably be minimal.
	    The upshot of this change is that record packing/unpacking is now
	    automated.
	Python binding changes:
	  - Preferences may be retrieved from an open DB.
	  
Jul 13, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.7.4

	Configuration changes:
	  - Integrated libtool 1.0 (thanks, Gord!)
	  - Automatic detection of GNU readline 2.0 and 2.1 (or later).
	  - libtool removed entirely from C++ section
	  - Itcl automatically detected, and tcl/tk from an itcl installation
	    will be detected. Itcl is not currently used, however.
	  - Adjusted to (re)support OS/2 compilation.
	  - Revised OS/2 makefiles by Mike Jarabek.
	Pisocket library changes:
	  - Fixed up a few headers to use PI_ARGS.
	  - Added compareTm function to compare tm's.
	Utilities:
	  - pilot-debug can now automatically utilise GNU readline 2.0 or 2.1
	    for decent line-editing support, and in theory anything past 2.1
	    should work as well.
	  - pilot-mail includes patches by Diego Zamboni <diegoz@labsec.Corp.Sun.COM>
	    to support reading of MH mail folders. (Note: this code does not
	    support file or folder locking, or non-contiguous message numbers.)
	Perl 5 binding changes:
	  - various dlp constants are now exported by PDA::Pilot.
	  - CompareTm function exportable which takes two tm style listrefs
	    and returns <0, 0, or >0.
	  - Fixed nasty bugs on packing appointments with alarms (alarm wouldn't
	    trigger properly), and on appointments without descriptions
	    (Datebook would crash).
	  - Modified typemap so module will not fail on earlier versions of Perl.
	Python binding changes:
	  - SetRecord now takes an optional second argument. If a non-zero integer,
	    the record will not be packed, and only the "raw" attribute will
	    be used.
	Tcl binding changes:
	  - Large chunks rewritten to increase functionality.
	  - Small, subtle, incomprehensible, and potentially bug-ridden chunks rewritten
	    to make channel code compatible with versions of Tcl prior to 8.0.
	  - "make test" should work.
	  - GetRecord and SetRecord commands supported, with packer support.
	  - Only memo records currently have packer support. Databases without defined
	    packers cannot be read.

Jul 6, 1997 	Kenneth Albanowski 0.7.3

	Heavily modifed Python binding to use OO approach to record manipulation
		and packing. Read the README and test.py files in the Python
		directory for more information.
	Added 'struct sockaddr;' reference to pi-socket.h to allow use by code
		that has not pulled in the full set of socket headers.
	Added to configure the --with-cpp and --with-perl5 options to allow
		choice (or avoidance, via '--without') of the C++ compiler and Perl
		5 interpreter, respectively. ('onfigure --help' for list.)
	Once library is built, interpreter bindings may be built via 'make Perl5',
		'make Tcl', or 'make Python'.
	Changed configure interpreter selection to try to choose newer interpreter
		versions over older ones.
	Removed shared library generation from C++ library (it has too much of a
		chance of breaking.)
	Reversed -I directives in Makefiles so that current headers come before
		installed headers.

Jun 29, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.7.2

	Complete reimplemenation of library production, using version 0.9h of
		Gordon Matzigkeit's libtool package.
	Added Tcl, Tk, & Python auto-detection to configure script (use
		'configure --help' to see what options can be modified.)
	Rewrote Python compilation to use standard dynamic compilation technique.
	Rewrote Tcl compilation to use libtool and to generate binaries.
	Added David Warren's patch to add serial delays for SGI.

Jun 22, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.7.1

	Added Ian's patches to install man-pages, and dump records in
		pilot-file.
	Added Andreas Wrede's patch to sync-ical.
	Added Tero Kivinen's patch to add RecordID to read-ical.
	Modified PI_AF_* constants to reduce likelyhood of conflicting with
		AF_INET constant.
	Added a new UNIX serial pause after baud rate negotation even if the
		rate didn't change. This prevents a dropped packet.
	Tuned serial pauses before and after baud rate change. I am now losing
		no packets at all. OS/2 code may need to be adjusted in a similar
		manner.
	Added pi_file_merge routine and -m switch to pilot-xfer. This merges
		record from a file into an existing database, which is especially
		useful for Dinkypad. Note that this could potentially damage some
		third-party application databases.

Jun 14, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.7.0

	Substantial modification to socket implementation. The serial and socket
		layers now have significantly more separation and modularity, with
		the goal of allowing clean serial implementations, across both
		architectures (os2, amiga, unix, etc.) and interfaces (direct
		serial, networked serial redirector, etc.). A higher layer will
		allow for connections that do not use the serial interface and
		protocols at all, though this is not utilized in this version.
	All pi_ functions that deal with addresses now use sockaddr struct *
		params instead of pi_sockaddr. Any C programs using pilot-link
		directly will need to be modified. The parameter is still a
		pi_sockaddr, but it must be cast to (struct sockaddr*), as with the
		genuine socket functions.
	The pi_port element has been removed from the pi_sockaddr structure. Any
		C code constructing these structures will have to be modified.
	All included programs and language bindings have been modified as
		described above.
	SLP, PADP, and syspackets recoded slightly to better deal with xid
		generation.
	The OS/2 and UNIX serial code was stripped out of serial.c, and placed
		into os2serial.c and unixserial.c. If you wish to port the serial
		layer, please do so in a new file (amigaserial.c, etc.)
	Added '-2' switch to getrom, which should retrieve the entire ROM if
		a PalmPilot and getrom2.prc are used.
	Getrom2.prc included from the latest version of CoPilot (I hope Greg
		doesn't mind.)

Jun 8, 1997 	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.6

	Added highly experimental networked connections. The concept is to run
		pi-port on a machine with a serial port, and have the real pilot
		utilities connect to this server via TCP/IP. The current code is
		supposed to work, but unfortunately is broken at the moment.
	Added experimental Tcl 8.0b1 binding.
	Modified Perl5 binding slightly, towards eventual goal of automatic
		app-specific record packing and unpacking.
	Modified Python test code slightly to demonstrate changing the Pilot's display
		during HotSync.
	Added CreateDB to Perl5 binding.
	pilot-debug patched to compile under Tcl8.0b1.
	pilot-xfer now properly fails if it cannot find a database to fetch.
	Fixed odd-data length problem in RPC code so pilot-clip can now
		successfully set the clipboard.

Jun 1, 1997 	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.5
	Patches for OS/2 supplied by Mike Jarabek <jarabemj@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>.

May 25, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.4

	Added pi_watchdog function to automatically tickle sockets.
	Modified dlpsh to use watchdog.
	Added get_s/set_s macros to manipulate signed Pilot values. The old routines
		are now officially unsigned.
	Modified get/set float routines to use signed macros.
	Added scripts/struct.pl, a first attempt at a portable structure preprocessor.
	Modified libsock/dlp.c to use struct.pl for ReadStorageInfo.

May 18, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.3

    Serial code uses PILOTPORT environment variable if a port isn't specified (but
    	note that the included utilities do not yet make use of this.)
	Perl 5 module now supports GetAppPref and SetAppPref functions (only the
		former is tested.)
	Removed 'bool' from Perl 5 code.
	Python SetAppPref function modified to match Perl calling sequence.
	Added RPC calls to Python interface (check out test.py).
	Revised various DLP functions to check for overlarge input buffers.
	New C++ code revision.

May 11, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.2

    Added pilot-undelete utility to un-archive records. Needs Perl 5.
	Added pilot-clip to retrieve (can not yet set) the pilot's clipboard.
	Repaired Python SetRecord and SetResource, which were broken.
	Added Unpack, Pack, PackAppBlock & UnpackAppBlock methods to Python DLP
	    object. (These automatically route to MemoUnpack, TodoUnpack, etc.)
	Removed all bool, true, & false from C++ code.
	If Perl 5 is around, use the flags it calculated for dynamically loadable code
	    to render the libraries position independant. (Experimental/hack.)
	Perl and Python examples now prompt for serial port.

Mar 4, 1997 	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.1

	Perl5 support nearly complete. Documentation less so.
	Python support nearly complete. Documentation less so.
    Scott's C++ and uchar_t cleanup.
	DLP ResetDBIndex now resets emulated category iterator.
	Fixed lib/serial variable definition. Really.
	Fixed long-standing bug in terminating card manufacturer's name.
	Fixed socket code leaking file descriptors and double closing.
	Modified socket code to return separate fd from pi_accept().
	Added suffixes and .cc definition to makefiles.
	Applied Mark Eichin's <eichin@cygnus.com> configure and makefile
	    portability patches.
	Applied David Warren's <dsw@comfortably-numb.asd.sgi.com> makefile and
	    socket portability patches.

Apr 28, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.6.0

	Primary feature: optional C++ support. If you have a C++ compiler, you'll
	   get new code, and a new library.
    Added Scott Grosch's <grosch@ichips.intel.com> C++ code, and completely
       mucked up autoconf getting it to understand optional C++ code.
	Paul Traina's <pst@Shockwave.COM> patches for pilot-mail's use of getopt.
    Fixed simple variable definition problem affecting SGTYY in serial.c
    Fixed lib/Makefile trailing slash and object duplication.
    Added pd-tty.c to break out tty/async display code from pilot-debug.
    Added GNU readline 2.0 support to pilot-debug (see Makefile).
    Added complete Pilot Expense application DB support.
    Added read-expenses program to document expenses reading.
    Modified lib/pi-file so it will not even attempt to install deleted records
       (even if the DB contains them) on an old Pilot, but will retrieve
       them if possible.

Apr 20, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.7
	
	Adaption for NeXTStep and Solaris configuration problems.
	  - Always use three arguments to fcntl.
	  - Use bmove for memmove even if memcopy is present.

Apr 13, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.6

    New pilot-mail excutable to directly support transmission and reception
       of internet mail through the Pilot Mail application present on newer
       Pilots. (Requires POP3 for reception and/or sendmail for transmission.)
    Fixed nasty bug in "long" DLP argument recognition. Please do not use 0.5.5.
    PalmOS 2.0 DLP functions DeleteCategory, ReadNextModifiedInCategory,
       ReadNextRecInCategory, ReadFeature, ReadAppPreference and
       WriteAppPreference are now emulated for 1.0 Pilots, and may be freely
       used where you like, regardless of OS version. (Untested)
    PalmOS 2.0 DLP functions repaired. (None would have worked in 0.5.5)
    Removed extraneous category parameter from dlp_ReadNext*Category functions.
    Added DLP function dlp_RPC, which allows invoking arbitrary system traps
       during HotSync.
    Fixed pilot-debug mirroring to display entire updated rectangle.
    Fixed uncaught decoding problem in unpack_ToDoAppInfo.
    DLP trace is now compiled in by default, but only activated if the
       PILOTDLP environment variable exists.

Apr 4, 1997		Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.5

    Added Ron Nicholson's <rhn@waltz.engr.sgi.com> patch for user-id setting
        in install-user.
    Added Jason S Kohles's <robobob@xmission.com> patch for excluding databases
        in pilot-xfer.
    Added pilot-schlep utility that allows you to carry a single UNIX file
        on your Pilot.
    Pilot-debug now can receive, display, enable, and disable screen updates. 
        (Type "mirror", then show the Remote UI window, and play with the Pilot.)
    Modified socket code to provide real descriptors from pi_socket that
        last through the bind, so they are directly selectable.
    Serial trace is now compiled in by default, but only activated
        if the PILOTLOG environment variable exists. (PILOTLOGFILE sets name.)
    Fixed baud-rate over 9600 "problem". (Mea culpa, I had commented out a
        call for testing purposes. My apologies.)
    Fixed rbuf leak in lib/pi-file.c. (Thanks to Scott Grosch for noticing.)
    With the gracious help of Palm, the following PalmOS 2.0 features are
       supported (though not yet tested):
    Updated CMP logic to match 2.0 versioning (extended CMP still to-do).
    Updated DLP decoding to decode long args (buffering and encoding rewrite to-do).
    Added v2.0 ReadFeature, DeleteCategory, ReadNextRecInCategory,  
        ReadNextModifiedRecInCategory, ReadAppPreference and WriteAppPreference
        DLP functions. (emulation for 1.0 Pilots to-do).
    Added v2.0 ReadNetSyncInfo and WriteNetSyncInfo functions (no 1.0 emulation
        possible.)
    Added v2.0 extension for CallApplication DLP function. (still works on 1.0)

Mar 22, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.4
	
	Added installation (and uninstallation) support to Makefile.
	Extensively reorganized pilot-debug startup, added Tcl event loop from
	    plus-patch, and removed Tk dependancy -- pilot-debug is now usable
	    with or without Tk! That means debugsh is officially deprecated,
	    unless there is a significant outcry for a Tcl-less debugger. 
	Modified syspkt RPC code to properly support byte values and pointers. 
	Added initial support for Personal PalmPilot -- but beware the
	    possibility of uncaught incompatibilities.
	Updated debugging routines in syspkt to more closely match Palm
	    documentation -- note that this breaks my original gdb patch.

Mar  9, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.3

	To help gdb, expanded syspkt support.
	Started reorganization of pilot-debug.

Mar  2, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.2

	Added Pilot-debug executable -- you'll need to modify Makefile to
	    compile it, read README for further instructions.
	Removed Linux DTR & RTS code, as per Ted Ts'o's request.
	Added Matthew Schnee's latest OS/2 patches.
	Changed default connection rate to 9600 from 19200. (For some reason
	    19200 now doesn't seem to be working on my machine. I have no
	    idea where the problem lies, hardware or software.)
	Modified lib/serial code (both UNIX and OS/2 sections) to use timeouts
	    specified in tenth seconds, allowing finer grained timeouts. This is
	    specifically used in the syspkt code to respond faster to RPC
	    failures.
	Modified lib/syspkt.c and include/pi-syspkt.h extensively to support
	    pilot-debug. This includes new packet transmission routines and
	    more modular RPC code.
	Added hack fix for deletion problem in pilot-addresses.
	
Feb 23, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.1

	Added getrom executable, and included getrom.prc from CoPilot
	    distribution with Greg Hewgill's permission.
	Completed data pack & unpack support for all Pilot applications.
	Modified headers and code (particularly dlp) to use new recordid_t
		typedef for record IDs. This should prevent one source of 
		sign problems.
	Modified dlp headers and code to pass all buffers as void*'s instead
	    of unsigned char *'s.
	Added experimental Perl5 linkage. To use, change to Perl5/PDAPilot
	    directory, run `perl Makefile.PL ; make test`, and stand back.
	    Most bits are currently missing and some bits don't work.

Feb  5, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.5.0

	Rearranged header files so they should be cleaner to externally use.
	Added pilot-dedupe program, which will automatically remove duplicate
		records from any Pilot database. (Use with caution on databases
		for third-party applications. It is safe to use on all of the
		standard databases.)
	Added useful serial trace. If SERIAL_TRACE is defined during
		compilation, then a complete trace of all serial activity (in and
		out) will be appended to PiDebug.log in the current directory. If
		you are getting low level failures of the software, please try
		generating one of these logs and mailing it to me
		(kjahds@kjahds.com) so I can attempt to find the problem.
	Made a few slight changes in various programs and headers to 
		reduce miscasts.
	Removed -Wall flag for CC compiler.

Jan 18, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.4.3

	Modified configure support for NeXT and OS/2.
	Added pilot-addresses program, a program designed to translate
		between a comma-separated-value format and the Pilot address book.
		In theory the format is compatible with the Palm Desktop
		import/export format. An "a" switch (Advanced/Augment) is available
		to output more data in a Desktop incompatible format.
		This software may be buggy! Always back up the DatebookDB database
		before installing records!
    Modified pilot-xfer to sort databases during Restore to put applications
        after their data, and larger records after smaller ones.
    Modified pilot-xfer to clear lastsyncpc value so that a fast sync will
        not be done with possibly missing sync flags on newly installed DBs.
	Added lib/address.c & addresses.c patches to simplify phone label storage. 
	Added -c switch to install-memo.c
	Added stub README.
	
Jan 9, 1997		Kenneth Albanowski 0.4.2

	Applied Pace's rm_fn patch, and pi-file patch for freads and attrs.
	My patch to return correct DLP errors.
	Probably some other stuff that I've forgotton.

Dec 30, 1996	Kenneth Albanowski 0.4.1

	Got sync-ical functional. It's very messy, but parts of it do actually
	   work.
	Added new trace code to lib/dlp. Enable with -DDLP_TRACE in makefile.
	Added remaining DLP functions. All but RPC are now implemented (and I
	   have not been able to deduce how to invoke RPC under DLP, so it
	   will stay unimplemented until somebody comes up with more information.)
	Pace's patch for dlp_ReadRecordIDList.
	Added patch to pi-file to successfully store zero-length records.
	_Also_ added patch to stop ignore records on database retrieval that
	   are archived or deleted. The reason is that without going to the
	   RPC layer, there is no way to store records with those attributes.
	Mucked about with getopt in pilot-xfer, hopefully for the better.
	Added uname detection to configure so that IRIX gets proper warning flag.
	
	-- sync code still in limbo, undoubtedly not helped by holiday season.
	   Patience is a virtue.

Dec 22, 1996    Kenneth Albanowski 0.4.0

    Removed {install,retrieve}-{pdb,prc} packages, replaced with
       pilot-xfer, which also includes general backup and listing functions. 
    Integrated Pace Willisson's pi-file code, replacing prc.c & pdb.c. (This
       new code, along with pilot-xfer, is intended to be production
       quality, and should be used as the basis for all attempts to
       manipulate Pilot files, as well as the stock mechanism for backing
       up a Pilot via Unix.)
    Added Pace's pdump, modified and renamed to pilot-file, which is used for
      dumping and exploring .pdb and .prc files.
    Wrote and tested sync.c abstract synchronization layer. All but category
      synchronization and the detail of when to use which sync type is implemented.
    Fleshed out sync-memodir program which can now successfully synchronize a
      Pilot with a "memo directory", a directory containing text files.
    (sync-ical is still useless stub)
    Integrated Bill Sommerfeld's patches for read-ical, padp, and syspkt.
    
    -- Removed sync code based on Palm algorithms, pending approval from
       Palm/USR. What remains is sufficient to overwrite one side with
       another, and to serve as a framework if people who have not seen Palm
       code want to implement their own algorithms.
       
       Quoting from lib/sync.c:
       
       * Revised revision: all sections of code directly derived (albeit in a
       * paraphased manner) from code in the Palm Conduit SDK, _which are not
       * blatently obvious and irreducible_ have been temporarily removed until
       * word is obtained from Palm that the code may be publically released.
       *
       * The issue that needs to be resolved is whether Palm Computing Inc. will
       * allow the public distribution of source code derived from source code in
       * their Pilot PC Conduit SDK. The licensing information that I recieved
       * with the PC and Mac SDKs is not sufficient to resolve this question.
       *
       * In keeping with the sprit of the EU practice for reverse engineering, the
       * interface that I have designed to plug into the Palm algorithms has been
       * retained.

Dec 10, 1996	Kenneth Albanowski 0.3.3

    Did more work on sync stuff, added sync-memodir.
    Added dlp_DeletedRecord, dlp_DeletedResource, and dlp_ReadRecordIDList.
    Pausing problems on some machines (other then Linux) still unsolved.
    Added 'ls' command to dlpsh.
    Turned 9600 limit back on for SGI.

Dec 1, 1996		Kenneth Albanowski 0.3.2

    Converted package to use autoconf for configuration.
    Cleaned up package so -Wall is clean.
    Added sync-ical stub. It does not do anything useful yet.

Nov 25, 1996    Kenneth Albanowski 0.3.1

    Integrated Ulrich Hertlein's SunOS patches (in slightly changed form).
    Integrated Matthew Schnee's final OS/2 patches (in slightly changed form).
    Added install-pdb, retrieve-prc, and retrieve-pdb.
    Added read-ical, which converts the Pilot's datebook and todo list
      into an Ical 2.x calendar.
    Renamed todos to read-todos to avoid conflict with common utility.
    Added Robert A. Kaplan's install-todos (slightly modified and renamed.)
    Got rid of CBAUD and memmove, defined ENOMSG if not present.
    Fixed PADP bug where unexpected packet in padp_rx would cause infinite loop.

Nov 12, 1996	Kenneth Albanowski 0.3.0

    Rewrote xid generation as part of PADP rewrite, and made it
      always an unsigned character
    Added stub lib/sync.c
    Added dependencies in lib/Makefile

Nov 1, 1996	D. Jeff Dionne 0.2.4
