I have finally started on something that I have been meaning to do for quite
a while, which is to write (or fix) manual pages for the pilot-link suite of
programs.

Each manual page created should be referenced from the SEE ALSO section of
the pilot-link(7) manual.

Each manual page created should reference the manual pages of other related
programs and pilot-link(7) in its SEE ALSO section.
