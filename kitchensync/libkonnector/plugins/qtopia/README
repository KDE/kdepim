This is a Qtopia1.5 Konnector Plugin + it can
read some more attributes.

It's technology was inspired by the white paper of
rsync and a talk with Trolltech.

The idea is to make a md5sum of a Record. The md5sum
replaces the the normal Revision and is also more reliable.
This way we only need to save uid + md5sum +
it should also be faster.
Besides that it is Opie Konnector based but the next 
technology.
The good bits will be backported to the OpieKonnector
when Opie switches to a DB!
