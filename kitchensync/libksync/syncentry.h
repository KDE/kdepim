  The SyncEntry class represents the basic unit of syncing. It provides an
  interface for identifying and comparing entries, which has to be
  implemented by concrete subclasses. This makes it possible to
  operate with one synchronisation algorithm on different Syncees.

  SyncEntry objects are collected by a @see Syncee objects.
