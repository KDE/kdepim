 * between syncs where two parties do not support the same
 * amount of attributes.
 * One party can create a specialised Merger and set it on the
 * Syncee to allow merging attributes from a different SyncEntry
 * into one belonging to the Syncee of the party.
 *
 * Your specialised class just need to implement the merge function. and call
 * setSynceeType
