   @short Syncing conflict resolution user interface.
   @author Cornelius Schumacher
   @see Syncer

   This class provides the abstract interface to a conflict resolution user
   interface. It is needed for cases, when a syncing process cannot resolve
   conflicts automatically. This is the case, when the same data entry has been
   changed in different data sets in an incompatible way.

   This class has to be implemented by a concrete subclass, which provides the
   actual user interface. While a GUI implementation, which provides interactive
   conflict resolution, is the most common implementation, there might also be
   use for a non-GUI or even non-interactive user interface.

      provide a more useful implementation to KSyncer.
