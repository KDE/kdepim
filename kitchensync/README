Developers, please check out the Documentation/ directory.
In particular:

Documentation/Architecture.docbook
	is an XML docbook file explaining how KitchenSync is
	structured and what its purpose is.
Documentation/HOWTO-CODE.txt
	tells you what the coding guidelines are. Like in most
	of KDE, you're expected to stick to the code style that
	you find in the project. I've documented the choices
	made so you know what you're up against.
