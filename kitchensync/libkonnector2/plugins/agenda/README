Here is a small skeleton for now showing how to develop
a KonnectorPlugin..
First of all it needs to inherit from KonnectorPlugin
and at least implement:

Kapabilities capablities() and the set function:
    Kapabilities are used to store configuration
    and to show what is possible with a device.
    Why not simply use a QWidget*. This lib is meant
    to be used let's say even with consolekalenar
    and a configuration widget wouldn't be working 
    in this case.
    
Nevertheless you can implement configWidget() this will be
    used with in GUI applications. If you do not want to implement
    it a widget using the Kapabilities will be created
    
startSync() 
    start sync should call the socket to start the syncing process
    ideally after all data and changes are collected sync() should be
    emitted
    
startBackup and startRestore should start and stop a backup process to a directory

connectDevice should try to connect to a device and it should emit progress and failure
see stdprog.h and stderror.h for some examples..

disconnectDevice should hangup the socket

KonnectorInfo should return the current state of the socket, some names, a QIconSet
some icon names if possible....

add() and remove() are meant to be used by custom ManipulatorParts which need to download
stuff during a sync operation. res can be anything from a simple url
to an action. The behaviour can be implemented as wished.

download() is called to immediately download a resource. In any case it should emit
a signal on failure or success

after a sync operation the pure virtual slot
write() gets called. There you should write back the Sycnee's and
emit a done() if you're done!!!

this is all a konnector needs to implement

KitchenSync uses a Container called Syncee which contains SyncEntries
a Konnector needs to convert the data of the device into a Syncee
if it can't be converted into a syncee it needs to put the data
into a UnknownSyncee to allow the filters to try to post process
the data

MetaSyncing is the true syncing. If a konnector is able to recognize
changes between the current state and the last sync it can use
meta syncing which is more accurat and faster and more reliable!
