Demo konnector with a threaded implementation. It origin is in the IrMC
Sync konnector. There is a worker thread which can happily block and a
manager thread which tries to start jobs if the worker is idle.
This implementation does nothing other then print debug messages via
kdDebug() and signal that it has finished. Fill the switch statement in
ClientThread::run() with life if you want to use this framework.

Enjoy synchronous programming.
