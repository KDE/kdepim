/**
  @short A data set to be synced.
  @author Cornelius Schumacher, zecke
  @see SyncEntry, Syncer

  This class represents a data set of SyncEntries. During a syncing process,
  two or more Syncees are synced. After syncing they are  equal, that
  means they should contain the same set of SyncEntries. Choices by the user
  can lead to deviations from complete equality.

  The Syncee class provides an interface, which has to be implemented by
  concrete subclasses.

  Further a Syncee can store a BitMap on what a 'Filler' of the Syncee supports.
  For example Device B got a todolist but has only 3 Attributes.
     Attribute 1: Description
     Attribute 2: Completed
     Attribute 3: DueDate

  The KDE todolist got roughly 10-15 Attributes
  So when syncing B with KDE, where B would replace KDE Records would lead
  to loss of up to 12 attributes.
  This will be avoided by a merge before a replaceEntry operation.
  This way B will take presedence on the 3 Attributes but we won't lose
  the additional attributes

  sets to be synced are added, call the sync() functions to perform the actual
