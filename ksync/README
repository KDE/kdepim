KSync and libksync
==================

libksync is a generic library for syncing collections of data entries like
calenders, bookmarks, contacts, mail folders etc. It provides an abstract
interface for syncing data sets and an implementation of a syncing algorithm. By
implementing of the interfaces for concrete data types you enable syncing of
sets of this data type.

Currently libksync includes implementations for syncing of calendars and
bookmarks.

KSync is a small application using libksync, which provides a GUI for selecting
and syncing files, which contain data of the types, for which implementations of
the libksync interfaces exist. It is able to sync data across networks by using
the KDE ioslaves.

If you have questions or comments or would like to join the development of ksync
and libksync please contact Cornelius Schumacher <schumacher@kde.org>.
