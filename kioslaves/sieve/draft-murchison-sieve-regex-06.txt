Abstract

    In some cases, it is desirable to have a string matching mechanism
    which is more powerful than a simple exact match, a substring match
    or a glob-style wildcard match.  The regular expression matching
    mechanism defined in this draft should allow users to isolate just
    about any string or address in a message header or envelope.

Internet Draft          Sieve -- Regex Extension           June 30, 2003



0.     Meta-information on this draft

    This information is intended to facilitate discussion.  It will be
    removed when this document leaves the Internet-Draft stage.


0.1.   Discussion

    This draft is intended to be an extension to the Sieve mail filtering
    language, available from the RFC repository as
    <ftp://ftp.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3028.txt>.

    This draft and the Sieve language itself are being discussed on the
    MTA Filters mailing list at <ietf-mta-filters@imc.org>.  Subscription
    requests can be sent to <ietf-mta-filters-request@imc.org> (send an
    email message with the word "subscribe" in the body).  More
    information on the mailing list along with a WWW archive of back
    messages is available at <http://www.imc.org/ietf-mta-filters/>.


0.2.   Noted Changes


0.2.1  since -05

    Added open issue regarding localization/internationalization.

    Added that implementations SHOULD reject regexes not supported by
    this extension.

    Editorial changes.


0.2.2  since -04

    Editorial changes.


0.3.   Open Issues

    The major open issue with this draft is what to do, if anything,
    about localization/internationalization.  Are [POSIX.2] collating
    sequences and character equivalents sufficient?

Internet Draft          Sieve -- Regex Extension           June 30, 2003


1.  Introduction

    This is an extension to the Sieve language defined by [SIEVE] for
    comparing strings to regular expressions.

    Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1, including
    use of [KEYWORDS].


2.  Capability Identifier

    The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
    document is "regex".


3.  Regex Match Type

    Commands that support matching may take the optional tagged argument
    ":regex" to specify that a regular expression match should be
    performed.  The ":regex" match type is subject to the same rules and
    restrictions as the standard match types defined in [SIEVE].  For
    convenience, the "MATCH-TYPE" syntax element defined in [SIEVE] is
    augmented here as follows:

         MATCH-TYPE  =/  ":regex"

    Example:

          require "regex";

          # Try to catch unsolicited email.
          if anyof (
            # if a message is not to me (with optional +detail),
            not address :regex ["to", "cc", "bcc"]
              "me(\\+.*)?@company\\.com",

            # or the subject is all uppercase (no lowercase)
            header :regex :comparator "i;octet" "subject"
              "^[^:lower:]+$" ) {

            discard;     # junk it
          }

    The ":regex" match type is compatible with both the "i;octet" and
    "i;ascii-casemap" comparators and may be used with them.

    Implementations MUST support extended regular expressions (EREs) as
    defined by [POSIX.2].  Any regular expression not defined by

    [POSIX.2], as well as [POSIX.2] basic regular expressions, word
    boundaries and backreferences are not supported by this extension.
    Implementations SHOULD reject regular expressions that are
    unsupported by this specification as a syntax error.

    The following table provides a brief summary of the regular
    expressions that MUST be supported.  This table is presented here
    only as a guideline.  [POSIX.2] should be used as the definitive
    reference.


    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    | Expression |  Pattern                                            |

    |     .      |  Match any single character except newline.         |
    |    [ ]     |  Bracket expression.  Match any one of the enclosed |
    |            |  characters.  A hypen (-) indicates a range of      |
    |            |  consecutive characters.                            |
    |   [^  ]    |  Negated bracket expression.  Match any one         |
    |            |  character NOT in the enclosed list.  A hypen (-)   |
    |            |  indicates a range of consecutive characters.       |
    |    \\      |  Escape the following special character (match      |
    |            |  the literal character).  Undefined for other       |
    |            |  characters.                                        |
    |            |  NOTE: Unlike [POSIX.2], a double-backslash is      |
    |            |  required as per section 2.4.2 of [SIEVE].          |

    |   [= =]    |  Character equivalents.                             |

    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |     ?      |  Match zero or one instances.                       |
    |     *      |  Match zero or more instances.                      |
    |     +      |  Match one or more instances.                       |
    |   {n,m}    |  Match any number of instances between              |
    |            |  n and m (inclusive).  {n} matches exactly n        |
    |            |  instances.  {n,} matches n or more instances.      |

4.  Security Considerations

    Security considerations are discussed in [SIEVE].  It is believed
    that this extension doesn't introduce any additional security
    concerns.

    However, a poor implementation COULD introduce security problems
    ranging from degradation of performance to denial of service.  If an
    implementation uses a third-party regular expression library, that
    library should be checked for potentially problematic regular
    expressions, such as "(.*)*".
