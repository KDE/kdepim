Abstract

    Users go to great lengths to be notified as quickly as possible that
    they have received new mail. Most of these methods involve polling
    to check for new messages periodically. A push method handled by the
    final delivery agent gives users quicker notifications and saves
    server resources. This document does not specify the notification
    method but is expected that using existing instant messaging
    infrastructure such as Zephyr, ICQ, or SMS messages will be popular.
    This draft describes an extension to the Sieve mail filtering
    language that allows users to give specific preferences for
    notification of Sieve actions.

Internet Draft      Sieve -- Notifications extension        June 1, 2001


1.  Introduction

    This is an extension to the Sieve language defined by [SIEVE] for
    providing instant notifications of sieve actions that have been
    preformed. It defines the new action "notify".

    This document does not dictate the notification method used.
    Examples of possible notification methods are Zephyr and ICQ. The
    method shall be site-defined.

    Sieve interpreters for which notifications are impractical or is not
    possible SHOULD ignore this extension.

    Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1, including
    use of [KEYWORDS].


1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].



2.  Capability Identifier

    The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
    document is "notify".



3.  Actions




3.1.  Notify action

    Syntax:   notify [":method" string]
               [":id" string]
               [":options" 1*(string-list / number)]
               [<":low" / ":normal" / ":high">]
               ["message:" string]

    The Notify action specifies that a notification should be sent to
    the user upon successful handling of this message.

    The format of the notification is implementation-defined. However,

Internet Draft      Sieve -- Notifications extension        June 1, 2001


    all content specified in the notify action, including Sieve actions
    taken on the message, SHOULD be included. If errors occurred in
    another action they SHOULD be reported in the notification. In
    addition, if the notification method does not provide a timestamp,
    one SHOULD be appended to the notification. Implementations SHOULD
    NOT include extraneous information.

    The :method tag identifies the notification method that will be
    used. If the :method tag is not specified, the default
    implementation defined notification method MUST be used.  The
    possible values of this will be site-specific.  If a method is
    specified that the implementation does not support, the notification
    MUST be ignored. An implementation treats this as a warning
    condition and execution of the sieve script MUST continue.

    The :id tag can be used to give the notify action an unique
    identifier. This identifier can be used later in the script to
    cancel the specific notify. The string may have any value and SHOULD
    NOT be included in the notification.

    The :options tag is used to send parameters to the notification
    method. This might be the phone number for an SMS message or a
    user's ICQ identifier.

    The priority parameter specifies the importance of the notification.
    The priority parameter has the following values: ":high" (very
    important), ":normal", and ":low" (not very important). If no
    priority is given, a default priority of ":normal" SHOULD be
    assumed. Some notification methods allow users to specify their
    state of activity (for example "busy" or "away from keyboard"). If
    the notification method provides this information it SHOULD be used
    to selectively send notifications.  If, for example, the user marks
    herself as "busy", an implementation SHOULD NOT send a notification
    for a new mailing list message with a priority of :low, however the
    user should be notified of a high priority action.  If the
    notification method allows users to filter messages based upon
    certain parameters in the message, users should be able to filter
    based upon priority. If the notification method does not support
    priority, then this parameter MUST be ignored.

    The :message tag specifies the message data to be included in the
    notification. The entirety of the string SHOULD be sent but
    implementations MAY shorten the message for technical or aesthetic
    reasons. Message may include the message variables defined below. If
    the message parameter is absent, a default message of "$from$:
    $subject$" will be used.

         $from$     - the display name or address of the RFC 822 from

Internet Draft      Sieve -- Notifications extension        June 1, 2001


         $env-from$ - the address of the RFC 821 from

         $subject$  - the subject of the message

         $text$     - the first text/* part

         $text[n]$  - the first n bytes of the first text/* part

    If there are errors sending the notification, the Sieve interpreter
    SHOULD ignore the notification and not retry indefinitely.

    This action MUST NOT cancel the implicit keep.

    Example:
         require ["notify","fileinto"];

            if header :contains "from" "boss@example.org" {
                notify :high "This is probably very important";
            }

            if header :contains "to" "sievemailinglist@example.org" {
                notify :low "[SIEVE] $from$: $subject$";
                fileinto "INBOX.sieve";
            }




3.2.  Denotify Action

    Syntax: denotify [MATCH-TYPE string] [<":low" / ":normal" /
    ":high">]

    The denotify action can be used to cancel a previous notification.
    If the priority, ":low" / ":normal" / ":high", is specified, then
    only cancel those notifications with the specified priority.  If a
    MATCH-TYPE with a string is specified, then only those notifications
    whose :id tag matches the specified string using the match-type
    operator are canceled.  The ascii-casemap comparator MUST be used.

    If no notifications exist that match the search criteria, then the
    denotify has no effect.  A denotify only cancels notifications that
    have already been requested.  It is not possible to preemptively
    cancel a notification.

    The sequence:

      denotify;

Internet Draft      Sieve -- Notifications extension        June 1, 2001


      notify;

    will still generate a notification.  The denotify does not cancel
    the notify.

    The following table shows which notifies would get cancelled:

                                        # what is cancelled
      denotify                          # all notifications
      denotify :matches "*"             # all notifications with :id tag
      denotify :high                    # all high priority notifications
      denotify :is "foobar"             # all notifications with id "foobar"
      denotify :matches "foo*" :normal  # all normal priority notifications
                                        #   with id that starts with "foo"

    Example:
             require "notify";

             notify :method "sms" :options "408-555-1212" :id "foobar";
             if header :contains "from" "boss@example.org" {
                notify :method "sms" :options "408-555-1212" :id "foobar" :high
                       :message "BOSS: $subject$";
             }

             if header :contains "to" "sievemailinglist@example.org" {
                denotify :is "foobar";
             }

             if header :contains "subject" "FYI:" {
                # don't need high priority notification for
                # a 'for your information'
                denotify :is "foobar" :high;
             }




4.  Interaction with Other Sieve Actions

    Notifications MUST be sent in all cases, unless a reject action is
    also executed. Users may wish to be notified of a message being
    discarded, for example. The reject action is given an exception
    because implementations may wish to restrict users from seeing the
    contents of a rejected message. However, notifications MAY be
    modified to not include any data from the original rejected message.

    The notify action MUST NOT cancel the implicit keep.

Internet Draft      Sieve -- Notifications extension        June 1, 2001


    The denotify action MUST NOT affect any actions other than the
    notify action.

    Failures of other actions MAY be reported in the notification.





5.  Security Considerations

    Security considerations are discussed in [SIEVE]. Additionally
    implementations must be careful to follow the security
    considerations of the specific notification methods. It is believed
    that this extension does not introduce any additional security
    concerns.

    The notify action is potentially very dangerous.  The path the
    notification takes through the network may not be secure.  An error
    in the options string may cause the message to be transmitted to
    someone it was not intended for.

    Just because a notification is received doesn't mean it was sent by
    the sieve implementation.  It might be possible to forge
    notifications with some notification methods.
