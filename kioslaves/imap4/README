This is s.carstens@gmx.de release of KDE 2.0 kioslave
for the IMAP protocol.

It supports LOGIN, AUTHENTICATE LOGIN, AUTHENTICATE ANONYMOUS and
AUTHENTICATE CRAM-MD5.
It supports the rfc2192 URL naming convention.

- UIDVALIDITY check is conditional
- put will check if the mailbox exists and create it
  or will append the data to that mailbox
  (no append after create)
  use edit->new->textfile from konqueror
- move will try to guess the correct destination
  as konqueror appends the source mailbox name to
  the destination
- del will currently delete empty directories,
  mark messages for deletion.
  If deleting a directory konqueror does the following:
  - list the box
  - take the box url + file name and try to delete it
  - delete the box
  As the konqueror created urls are invalid we ignore them
  at the moment.
- relative URL's are not supported because
  konqueror will not handle them
- there are 2 additional section keywords
  ENVELOPE will do a FETCH ENVELOPE
  STRUCTURE will do a FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE
  normal behaviour is FETCH BODY.PEEK[section]
  
- the mime types delivered are not really consistent
  with the returned data
  - it will return inode/directory on list entries
    which contain inferiors
  - it will return message/digest on selectable mailboxes
    with file type S_IFDIR
  - type message/rfc822-imap on selected messages
	and type S_IFREG
	
In Konqueror set the mimetype message/rfc822 to use
the inline viewer.

Try it:  imap://user@host/
         imap://user;AUTH=*@host/
		 imap://user;AUTH=LOGIN@host/
		 imap://user;AUTH=CRAM-MD5@host/
