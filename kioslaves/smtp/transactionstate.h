  /**
     @short A class modelling an SMTP transaction's state
     
     This class models SMTP transaction state, ie. the collective
     result of the MAIL FROM:, RCPT TO: and DATA commands. This is
     needed since e.g. a single failed RCPT TO: command does not
     neccessarily fail the whole transaction (servers are free to
     accept delivery for some recipients, but not for others).

     The class can operate in two modes, which differ in the way
     failed recipients are handled. If @p rcptToDenyIsFailure is true
     (the default), then any failing RCPT TO: will cause the
     transaction to fail. Since at the point of RCPT TO: failure
     detection, the DATA command may have already been sent
     (pipelining), the only way to cancel the transaction is to take
     down the connection hard (ie. without proper quit).

     Since that is not very nice behaviour, a second mode that is more
     to the spirit of SMTP is provided that can cope with partially
     failed RCPT TO: commands.
