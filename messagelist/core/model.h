 * subclass (which is MessageList::View).
 *
 * The keypoint in this class is that it has to be non-blocking in manipulating the tree:
 * fill, cleanup and update operations are performed in timed chunks. Perfect non-blocking
 * behaviour is not possible since there are some small operations that basically can't be
 * splitted in chunks. However, these exceptions apply to a minority of tasks and
 * in the average case the user will not notice.
 *
 * The data for building the tree is obtained from a subclass of StorageModel. The
 * StorageModel must offer a consistent rappresentation of a "flat" folder containing
 * messages.
