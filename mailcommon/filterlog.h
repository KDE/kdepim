 * @short KMail Filter Log Collector.

 * The filter log helps to collect log information about the
 * filter process in KMail. It's implemented as singleton,
 * so it's easy to direct pieces of information to a unique
 * instance.
 * It's possible to activate / deactivate logging. All
 * collected log information can get thrown away, the
 * next added log entry is the first one until another
 * clearing.
 * A signal is emitted whenever a new logentry is added,
 * when the log was cleared or any log state was changed.
