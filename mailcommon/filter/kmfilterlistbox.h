/**
 * This is a complex widget that is used to manipulate a mail program's filter
 * list. It consists of an internal list of filters, which is a deep
 * copy of the list KMFilterMgr manages, a QListBox displaying that list,
 * and a few buttons used to create new filters, delete them, rename them
 * and change the order of filters.
 *
 * It does not provide means to change the actual filter (besides the name),
 * but relies on auxiliary widgets (SearchPatternEdit and KMFilterActionEdit)
 * to do that.
 *
 * Communication with this widget is quite easy: simply create an instance,
 * connect the signals filterSelected, resetWidgets and applyWidgets with
 * a slot that does the right thing and there you go...
 *
 * This widget will operate on it's own copy of the filter list as
 * long as you don't call slotApplyFilterChanges. It will then
 * transfer the altered filter list back to KMFilterMgr.
 *
 * @short A complex widget that allows managing a list of MailCommon::MailFilter's.
 * @author Marc Mutz <mutz@kde.org>, based upon work by Stefan Taferner <taferner@kde.org>.
 * @see MailCommon::MailFilter KMFilterDialog KMFilterActionEdit SearchPatternEdit
