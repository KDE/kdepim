/** This class is an abstraction of a search over messages.  It is
    intended to be used inside a KFilter (which adds KFilterAction's),
    as well as in KMSearch. It can read and write itself into a
    KConfig group and there is a constructor, mainly used by KMFilter
    to initialize from a preset KConfig-Group.

    From a class hierarchy point of view, it is a QPtrList of
    SearchRule's that adds the boolean operators (see Operator)
    'and' and 'or' that connect the rules logically, and has a name
    under which it could be stored in the config file.

    As a QPtrList with autoDelete enabled, it assumes that it is the
    central repository for the rules it contains. So if you want to
    reuse a rule in another pattern, make a deep copy of that rule.
