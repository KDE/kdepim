...for the next release:

- GNKSA certification (http://www.xs4all.nl/~js/gnksa/)
  KNode 0.2 should be compliant with all MUSTs, we
  want to improve our score on the SHOULDs and then
  apply for a review.
- posting (and reading to some degree) is currently
  broken for non iso-8895-X languagues/charsets.
  We want to fix this, please contact us if you want
  to help us testing.
- internal code cleanup

and of course much more in the future,
but we have no concrete plans yet. ;-)
