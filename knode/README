KNode is a newsreader for the K Desktop Environment.

It is GNKSA compliant (unfortunally a review is still
pending), and has support for MIME and multiple servers.

It is a online-reader, but in combination with a
local newsserver like leafnode also usable with dial-up
connections.

KNode is written in C++ using KDevelop, a new IDE for KDE 
(thanx to the whole KDevelop-team for their excellent work).
It is published under the GNU General Public License
and comes without any warranty.
