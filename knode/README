KNode is a newsreader for the K Desktop Enviroment. 
It is a pure online-reader, that is supposed to be used with a 
local newsserver. I have only tested it with leafnode and inn, but it
should work with every server, that supports the xover-command.
KNode is currently alpha quality software, although it seems 
to be quite stable. At the moment it does not have to much features, 
but the basic functionality is implemented and seems to work fine.
KNode is written in C++ using KDevelop, a new IDE for KDE 
(thanx to the whole KDevelop-team for their excellent work).
It is published under the GNU General Public License
and comes without any warranty.

IMPORTANT: Since Version 0.1.5 a file-format of KNode has changed.
If you are upgrading from a Version before 0.1.5, you will have to
convert your old files.
This can be done by starting KNode in an xterm with the "-c" option
followed by the number of the version you are upgrading from.
This has to be done after the installation of the new version.

Example: Upgrade from 0.1.1 to 0.1.6
1. Install version 0.1.6 as described above.
2. Open an xterm or kvt and type the following : knode -c 0.1.1
3. Enjoy the new features of KNode ;-)
