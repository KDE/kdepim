DONE:
-----
- devices:/ kioslave integration
- show per-device icons in konqueror (same as in the kmobile view)
- fix mimetypes and their location under /share/mimelnk
- kioslaves: cellphone:/, organizer:/, pda:/, (camera:/ not activated)
- system tray plugin

TODO:
-----
- finish the functions which are available to client apps.
- kitchensync driver/plugin (starting...)
- a plugin for the left side of the "Open File Dialog". ->
  makes direct access to mobile devices really easy
- more drivers


TODO (lower priority):
----------------------
- a kmobile-driver, which can connect to another KDE-computer
  to be able to access Calendar-Entries, ToDo's, ... from there
  and to be able to syncronize them via kitchensync (maybe?)
