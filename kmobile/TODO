- system tray plugin
- serial/IRDA/(USB?) locking features (acording to standards - done, but untested !!)

TODO:

- fix doubled loading of plugins
- where do I get the device name from the kmobile unique process? 
- finish the functions which are available to client apps.
- kitchensync driver/plugin (starting...)
- a plugin for the left side of the "Open File Dialog". ->
  makes direct access to mobile devices really easy
- make the daemon a KDED (KDE Meta Daemon) module (kdelibs/kded/HOWTO, README.kded)

General Interface TODO:
-----------------------
- automatic logoff timers
- Authentication


TODO (lower priority):
----------------------
- a kmobile-driver, which can connect to another KDE-computer
  to be able to access Calendar-Entries, ToDo's, ... from there
  and to be able to syncronize them via kitchensync (maybe?)
