/**
 *  @short A colour selection combo box whose colour list can be specified.
 *
 *  The ColourCombo class is a combo box allowing the user to select a colour.
 *
 *  It is similar to KColorCombo but allows the list of colours to be restricted to those
 *  which are specified. The first item in the list is a custom colour entry, which allows
 *  the user to define an arbitrary colour. The remaining entries in the list are preset
 *  by the program.
 *
 *  The widget may be set as read-only. This has the same effect as disabling it, except
 *  that its appearance is unchanged.
