kjots (version 0.3.0) - a note taker
------------------------------------

Hi !

New versions of kjots go directly into the kdeutils distribution.
This is for version 0.3.0.

What is kjots
-------------

Name and idea for this program are taken from the jots program included
in the tkgoodstuff package by Mark Crimmins (markcrim@umich.edu).

Kjots helps you to write down some notes and maybe reduces the stack of
paper lying on your desk.

New in this version
-------------------

- added lots of keyboard shortcuts


Regards.

        Chris.
