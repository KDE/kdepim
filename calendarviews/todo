* When we extract to-do view we need another level in the hierarchy -> calendarviews/eventviews/agenda
                                                                                               /month
                                                                                    /todo

* Make the configuration specific to agenda, remove korganizer stuff

* Review collectionSelection stuff in eventview.h

* Remove Q3Support

* We should only export agendaview, now we need to export agenda and timelabels because of multiagendaview, which still isn't extracted from korganizer.
