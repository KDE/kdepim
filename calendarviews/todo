* When we extract to-do view we need another level in the hierarchy -> calendarviews/eventviews/agenda
                                                                                               /month
                                                                                    /todo

* Make the configuration specific to agenda, remove korganizer stuff

* KOEventView::printType stays in korganizer, in the container
