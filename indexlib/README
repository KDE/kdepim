WHAT'S THIS?

This is indexlib, an indexing library.

HOW TO USE INDEXLIB

The most important files are index.h and create.h which are the programmer's interface (API).

HOW TO START HACKING INDEXLIB INTERNALS

1. Understand the basics about how everything is really kept on disk and the file formats.
   Reading the docs in the docs/ directory should be good enough.

2. Email me (luis@luispedro.org) if you have any doubts.

HOW TO DEBUG

1. Get boost (http://www.boost.org/) and install it. There are packages for most linux distros.

2. Enable debugging output (Recompile with boost, define DEBUG).

3. Run the test suite (compile test.cpp and link with indexlib and boost_unit_test).

4. If the unit tests are all OK, but you still think the code is broken, try to write a test case which catches it.
