/**
 * \brief A class for string matching
 *
 * This class represents a pattern in a pre-processed form so that searching for it in larger textes is
 * very fast. This allows for a very fast way to ask "does this pattern appear in this text?"
 *
 * The implementation uses the shift-or algorithm which is very fast, but especially designed for
 * patterns which are shorter than the number of bits in a word ( 32 bits on most architechtures ). For
 * larger patterns, the first 32 characters are matched using shift-or and the next characters are strcmp()ed.
 * Even for patterns larger than 32 characters, this should be a fast strategy.
