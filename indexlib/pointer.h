/**
 * \class pointer
 *
 * Works with \ref thing in providing disk translucency (not transparency, but half-way there).
 *
 * This is a pointer like object which is really an index into a memory block which must be deferenced
 * every time it is accessed. The main advantage of this is that it allows the pointer to remain valid even
 * if the base memory block changes place.
 *
 * Actually, implementation-wise, thing does all this already and this is mainly an adapter.
