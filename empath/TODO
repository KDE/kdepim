Highest priority first.

* Finish composition code - adding attachments etc.

* Finish DnD - connect to relevant slots and test.

* Use open folder icons when appropriate.

* kioslaves need to be worked in for POP (working on), IMAP, and possibly SMTP
  (where a kioslave would have to be written !)
  
* Implement simple (to one host) SMTP sending.

* Switch to using KAction everywhere and sort out some accelerator keys,
  including mutt+vi style !

* Provide an external interface that allows triggering a mail check,
  retrieving a message, sending, etc. Will use DCOP, I think.
  Update: In progress. See lib/EmpathInterface.(cpp|h)

* Release !
