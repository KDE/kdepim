Things you might want to VOLUNTEER for :)

Highest priority first.

* Drag and drop - Working on this but I need HELP ! It's not working right !

* Test sendmail and qmail sending. Add user feedback.

* Nail down the parser (rmm). It's still buggy when creating message parts
  yourself and trying to put them together.
  
* kioslaves need to be worked in for POP, IMAP, and possibly SMTP (where a
  kioslave would have to be written !)
  
* Find a way to both use a message cache, AND allow messages larger than the
  maximum size for the cache. If I limit the cache to 1Mb to keep mem usage down
  then I also end up refusing to show large messages ! If I resize the cache,
  and then set it back down, the message will be deleted !
 
* Use an OpenPart for the mail editor.

* Come up with an intelligent solution to the password storage problem.

* Implement simple (to one host) SMTP sending.

* Make printing work. HTML view will do it itself, though a little weirdly.
  Will there be a general KDE printing i/f ? Do I make stuff ps first ?
  
* Plug memory leaks. Basically this just means putting setAutoDelete() back
  in various parts of rmm. I think this crashes because of a Qt bug.

===============================================================================
Little things I need to do. Highest priority first.

* Make filters work again, and fix their config dialogs.

* Word wrap in message view widget
  
* Disable menu entries where appropriate. (started)

* Make forwarding work properly. If only one plain body part -> just
  add some text stating this is forwarded, else attach as message/rfc822 ?
  
* Use open folder icons when appropriate ?

* Use inbox, outbox etc icons where appropriate ?

* Make From: bit in header view widget active as HTML label - basically need
  some way to be able to mail to or add to non-existant address book.
  
===============================================================================

Bugs in Qt/KDE (possibly)

* KTMainWindow layout isn't working. Probably my fault, though the layout
  code has just changed...

* KHTMLWidget crashes on some valid html.

* Sometimes KMenuBar doesn't show some entries until the mouse passes over them.

* DnD doesn't work right. Me or Qt ? Probably me.

* setUpdatesEnabled doesn't work.

* setSelected(!isSelected) doesn't work in list view.
