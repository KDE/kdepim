Things you might want to VOLUNTEER for :)

* Test sendmail sending. Add user feedback.

* Test qmail sending. Add user feedback.

* Implement simple (to one host) SMTP sending.
  
* Using an external editor needs reorganising so that a class encapsulates the
  process(es) that have been spawned.
  -- Started on this
  
* EmpathComposeWidget uses the fancy Netscape-alike thing where when you add
  headers, more widgets are created. What needs to happen is that when the user
  uses header names that aren't in the order of the base list, next time they
  get what they did before:
  e.g. user enters the to body, presses enter, changes Cc: to Reply-To: We then
  remember that they wanted Reply-To: next and next time when they press enter
  after To:, they get Reply-To:

* kioslaves need to be worked in for POP, IMAP, and possibly SMTP (where a
  kioslave would have to be written !)

* Find a way to both use a message cache, AND allow messages larger than the
  maximum size for the cache. If I limit the cache to 1Mb to keep mem usage down
  then I also end up refusing to show large messages ! If I resize the cache,
  and then set it back down, the message will be deleted !

* Sort out the mime handling. Currently all messages are treated as just plain
  text. I've started to put the mechanism into place, but it's hard work.
   
* Finish off doing the apply/revert stuff in the config dialogs. It's almost
  done, but just needs looking at and checking it really works properly.
  
* Sort out adding folders. For some reason the folder name doesn't appear in
  the FolderWidget. Also, the FolderWidget shouldn't collapse the tree when
  a folder is added. This is a symptom of the fact I'm calling 'update()' on
  the FolderWidget via a signal. Some more intelligence is necessary.
  
* mbox and MMDF handling. (Started but untested and unused as yet)

* IMAP and news. IMAP should be via kio_imap, like POP will be. NNTP ? Will
  there be an NNTP kioslave ?
  
* Come up with an intelligent solution to the password storage problem.

* Find out if the reason that setUpdatesEnabled(false) on a QListView doesn't
  work properly is Qt's fault.
  
* Sort out a way to rearrange the widgets in the main window. I might be doing
  a konqueror style thing, but I can't really allow more than one of each of
  FolderWidget, MessageListWidget and MessageViewWidget. They need to be
  connected via signals and slots to update each other.
  
* Sort the status indicator issue. I really want to do something in the same
  style as Outlook, but not as stupid, of course. Basically a multiple-indicator
  widget that could possibly have the option of being 'swallowed' within the
  main window, or simply act as a dialog (non-modal, of course).
  We could just use the statusbar when there's only one task in the list. That
  would be cool.
  - Working on this
  
* Drag and drop.

* Switch on recursive deletion of folders in EmpathMailboxMaildir.
