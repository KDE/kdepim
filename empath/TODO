Things you might want to VOLUNTEER for :)

* Sending mail via sendmail seems a little flaky and there's no way to tell the
  user what's going on. I'm going to drop QMTP as it seems like no-one uses it, but I
  still need to get SMTP sending going.
  
* Using an external editor needs reorganising so that a class encapsulates the
  process(es) that have been spawned.
  
* EmpathComposeWidget uses the fancy Netscape-alike thing where when you add
  headers, more widgets are created. What needs to happen is that when the user
  uses header names that aren't in the order of the base list, next time they
  get what they did before:
  e.g. user enters the to body, presses enter, changes Cc: to Reply-To: We then
  remember that they wanted Reply-To: next and next time when they press enter
  after To:, they get Reply-To:

* kioslaves need to be worked in for POP, IMAP, and possibly SMTP (where a kioslave would
  have to be written !)

* Actually do the multiple-parts thing in rmm (message parsing library). You may want
  to have a chat with me about this one, so I can show you how it needs to work.
