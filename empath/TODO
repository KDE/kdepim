Things you might want to VOLUNTEER for :)

Highest priority first.

* Make forwarding work properly. If only one plain body part -> just
  add some text stating this is forwarded, else attach as message/rfc822 ?

* Drag and drop - Working on this but I need HELP ! It's not working right !

* Test sendmail and qmail sending. Add user feedback.

* Nail down the parser (rmm). It's still buggy when creating message parts
  yourself and trying to put them together.
  
* kioslaves need to be worked in for POP, IMAP, and possibly SMTP (where a
  kioslave would have to be written !)
  
* Find a way to both use a message cache, AND allow messages larger than the
  maximum size for the cache. If I limit the cache to 1Mb to keep mem usage down
  then I also end up refusing to show large messages ! If I resize the cache,
  and then set it back down, the message will be deleted !
 
* Come up with an intelligent solution to the password storage problem.

* Implement simple (to one host) SMTP sending.

* Replace all the accel keys stuff once I'm sure it's not going to change.

* Make printing work. HTML view will do it itself, though a little weirdly.
  Will there be a general KDE printing i/f ? Do I make stuff ps first ?
    
* Use open folder icons when appropriate ?

* Use inbox, outbox etc icons where appropriate ?

* Make From: bit in header view widget active as HTML label - basically need
  some way to be able to mail to or add to non-existant address book.

* Plug memory leaks. Basically this just means putting setAutoDelete() back
  in various parts of rmm. I think this crashes because of a Qt bug.
  
* Implement locking of index files. Will have to use dotlocking to ensure it'll
  work over NFS.
  
* CORBA !
  x Use an OpenPart for the mail editor.
	(I could use KWord if I didn't loathe HTML mail !)
	
  x Make the mail reading stuff, the message listing stuff, the folder listing
  stuff, etc, all into OpenParts. Perhaps. Necessary ? Well, at least the
  compose stuff.

  x Talk to Simon Hausmann again about this stuff, and get another copy of
  that idl I lost :(

===============================================================================

Bugs in Qt/KDE (possibly)

* KTMainWindow layout fixes my toplevels' size sometimes.

* KHTMLWidget crashes on some valid html. ** Found out it's trying desperately
  to parse stuff in <PRE> and failing.

* Sometimes KMenuBar doesn't show some entries until the mouse passes over them.
  ** This is being worked on, I hear

* DnD doesn't work right. Me or Qt ? Probably me.
  ** Apparently some of this is actually Qt's fault

* QListView::setUpdatesEnabled() doesn't work.
