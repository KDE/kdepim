Things you might want to VOLUNTEER for :)

Highest priority first.

* Make forwarding work properly. If only one plain body part -> just
  add some text stating this is forwarded, else attach as message/rfc822 ?

* Drag and drop - Wilco is working on this

* Nail down the parser (rmm). It's still buggy when creating message parts
  yourself and trying to put them together.
  
* kioslaves need to be worked in for POP (working on), IMAP, and possibly SMTP
  (where a kioslave would have to be written !)
  
* Find a way to both use a message cache, AND allow messages larger than the
  maximum size for the cache. If I limit the cache to 1Mb to keep mem usage down
  then I also end up refusing to show large messages ! If I resize the cache,
  and then set it back down, the message will be deleted !
  Working on this...
 
* Come up with an intelligent solution to the password storage problem.

* Implement simple (to one host) SMTP sending.

* Replace all the accel keys stuff once I'm sure it's not going to change.

* Make printing work. HTML view will do it itself, though a little weirdly.
  Will there be a general KDE printing i/f ? Do I make stuff ps first ?
    
* Use open folder icons when appropriate ?

* Use inbox, outbox etc icons where appropriate ?

* Make From: bit in header view widget active as HTML label - basically need
  some way to be able to mail to or add to (non-existant) address book.

* Plug memory leaks. Basically this just means putting setAutoDelete() back
  in various parts of rmm. I think this crashes because of a Qt bug.
  
* Implement locking of index files. Update: Should work ok with gdbm now.
  
* CORBA !

 (Work in progress...)
