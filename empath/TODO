Things you might want to VOLUNTEER for :)

Highest priority first.

* Drag and drop - Working on this but I need HELP ! It's not working right !

* Test sendmail and qmail sending. Queuing and sending is broken today. I'm
  working on it but I'd like help. Add user feedback.

* Nail down the parser (rmm). It's still buggy when creating message parts
  yourself and trying to put them together.
  
* kioslaves need to be worked in for POP, IMAP, and possibly SMTP (where a
  kioslave would have to be written !)
  
* Find a way to both use a message cache, AND allow messages larger than the
  maximum size for the cache. If I limit the cache to 1Mb to keep mem usage down
  then I also end up refusing to show large messages ! If I resize the cache,
  and then set it back down, the message will be deleted !
 
* Use an OpenPart for the mail editor.

* Come up with an intelligent solution to the password storage problem.

* Implement simple (to one host) SMTP sending.

* EmpathComposeWidget uses the fancy Netscape-alike thing where when you add
  headers, more widgets are created. What needs to happen is that when the user
  uses header names that aren't in the order of the base list, next time they
  get what they did before:
  e.g. user enters the to body, presses enter, changes Cc: to Reply-To: We then
  remember that they wanted Reply-To: next and next time when they press enter
  after To:, they get Reply-To:
  
* Make printing work. HTML view will do it itself, though a little weirdly.
  Will there be a general KDE printing i/f ? Do I make stuff ps first ?
  
* Plug memory leaks. Basically this just means putting setAutoDelete() back
  in various parts of rmm. This caused crashes for me, and I couldn't figure
  out the cause, but it shouldn't be too much hassle. The rest of Empath
  is pretty leak-free I think, due to the lack of allocating anything ;)

===============================================================================
Little things I need to do. Highest priority first.

* Think about and possibly redesign the compose widget.

* Sort out layout in filter dialogs.

* Allow priority ordering in filter manager dialog.

* Find out why sometimes when you select a message for the first time it isn't
  shown.
  
* When you bring up the popup menu over the message list, the item is selected
  but not shown. Need to allow it to be shown if it is clicked with the left
  button immediately afterwards.
  
* Disable menu entries where appropriate.

* Allow sort order in folder widget

* Find out why compose widget sometimes resizes to very small.

* Allow user to save, print etc the various parts of a message. When pressing
  'Message->Print', ask which part they want to print, unless there's only one.
  EmpathMessageStructureWidget will be useful for this.

* Make forwarding work properly. If only one plain body part -> just
  add some text stating this is forwarded, else attach as message/rfc822 ?
  
* Use open folder icons when appropriate ?

* Use inbox, outbox etc icons where appropriate ?

* Make clicking on a URL work both in HTML view and about box.

* Make From: bit in header view widget active as HTML label - basically need
  some way to be able to mail to or add to non-existant address book.
  
===============================================================================

Bugs in Qt (possibly)

* DnD doesn't work right. Me or Qt ? Probably me.

* setUpdatesEnabled doesn't work.

* setSelected(!isSelected) doesn't work in list view.
