Highest priority first.

* Finish composition code - adding attachments etc.

* Finish DnD - connect to relevant slots and test.

* Use open folder icons when appropriate.

* kioslaves need to be worked in for POP (working on), IMAP, and possibly SMTP
  (where a kioslave would have to be written !)
  
* Implement simple (to one host) SMTP sending.

* Add (configurable) accelerator keys.

* Go back to using templates for viewing messages instead of
  EmpathHeaderViewWidget etc.

* Provide an external interface that allows triggering a mail check,
  retrieving a message, sending, etc. Will use DCOP, I think.

* Make printing work. HTML view will do it itself, though a little weirdly.
  Will there be a general KDE printing i/f ? Do I make stuff ps first ?

* Plug memory leaks.

* Release !
