Things you might want to VOLUNTEER for :)

* Test sendmail sending. Add user feedback.
* Test qmail sending. Add user feedback.
* Implement simple (to one host) SMTP sending.
  
* EmpathComposeWidget uses the fancy Netscape-alike thing where when you add
  headers, more widgets are created. What needs to happen is that when the user
  uses header names that aren't in the order of the base list, next time they
  get what they did before:
  e.g. user enters the to body, presses enter, changes Cc: to Reply-To: We then
  remember that they wanted Reply-To: next and next time when they press enter
  after To:, they get Reply-To:

* kioslaves need to be worked in for POP, IMAP, and possibly SMTP (where a
  kioslave would have to be written !)

* Find a way to both use a message cache, AND allow messages larger than the
  maximum size for the cache. If I limit the cache to 1Mb to keep mem usage down
  then I also end up refusing to show large messages ! If I resize the cache,
  and then set it back down, the message will be deleted !

* Come up with an intelligent solution to the password storage problem.

* Sort out a way to rearrange the widgets in the main window. I might be doing
  a konqueror style thing, but I can't really allow more than one of each of
  FolderWidget, MessageListWidget and MessageViewWidget. They need to be
  connected via signals and slots to update each other.
  
* Drag and drop - Working on this

===============================================================================
Little things I need to do:

* Make folder widgets set totals correctly.

* Implement cut/copy/paste etc in editor. How ? I should be using an OpenPart
  editor.

* Make reply to all work.

* Make forwarding work properly. If only one plain body part -> just
  add some text stating this is forwarded, else attach as message/rfc822 ?

* Allow user to save, print etc the various parts of a message. When pressing
  'Message->Print', ask which part they want to print, unless there's only one.

* Fix external editor.

* Make clicking on a URL work both in HTML view and about box.

* Make From: bit in header view widget active as HTML label - basically need
  some way to be able to mail to or add to non-existant address book.

* Sod the 'View source' things, and simply allow switching to source view,
  but only in the view window.

* Fix the right-button-menu on the folder list. Tag -> Untag == OK. Mark as
  read and replied don't seem to change for some reason unbeknownest to me.
