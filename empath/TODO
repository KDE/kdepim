Highest priority first.

* Make a general gdbm-like class from KSycoca stuff and use
  this instead of gdbm.

* Make forwarding work properly. If only one plain body part -> just
  add some text stating this is forwarded, else attach as message/rfc822 ?
  Update: Wilco is working on this.

* Drag and drop
  Update: Wilco is working on this

* Use open folder icons when appropriate ?

* Nail down the parser (rmm). It's still buggy when creating message parts
  yourself and trying to put them together. Sometimes a pure virtual method
  gets called and I haven't tracked that down.
  
* kioslaves need to be worked in for POP (working on), IMAP, and possibly SMTP
  (where a kioslave would have to be written !)
  
* Implement simple (to one host) SMTP sending.

* Add (configurable) accelerator keys.

* Provide an external interface that allows triggering a mail check,
  retrieving a message, sending, etc. Will use DCOP, I think.

* Make printing work. HTML view will do it itself, though a little weirdly.
  Will there be a general KDE printing i/f ? Do I make stuff ps first ?

* Make From: bit in header view widget active as HTML label - basically need
  some way to be able to mail to or add to (non-existant) address book.
  Update: This wasn't done due to KHTMLLabel crashing things. Can now
  go try it.
  
* Plug memory leaks.

* Release !
