Potential developers:

See TODO for what you can help with.

I'm currently working on making rmm (the message parsing library) do lazy
parsing. It's already semi-working, and there's a HUGE speed increase.
Amazing, in fact. It's also more convenient within Empath (and any other code
using rmm) as you don't need to worry about parse() and assemble() any more.
It's all automatic :)

Please mail me to let me know what you're interested in doing.
This doesn't have to be coding, it can be providing input for the design of
the system, drawing icons, writing docs, translating, testing, etc. The more
the merrier.

Obviously the more coders the faster this will stabilise, but I consider the
system as a whole to be important - users will need docs to read, and to be
able to use Empath in their native language. I can do most of the Italian
translation myself.

* GETTING STARTED *

You need:

a) A Maildir, with some mail in it. I suggest using mail from an existing
   Maildir (you can use mutt to do this). Back it up, then put it in place in
   ~/Maildir
   
FOR INFORMATION ON THE DESIGN:

Read DESIGN

Note that the ChangeLog is now a little out of date.
The design_docs stuff is basically me just writing stuff down so that I
understand what I'm doing.
