Requirements:

  You will need to use a Maildir format mailbox. Read README.maildir

  You need the snapshot of Qt from the 9th of October 1999. This snapshot
  is compatible with the current KDE source.

  You also need to get the current versions of kdesupport and kdelibs.
  
  You can either:
  1. Get a snapshot via ftp.
  2. Get a local copy of the sources via cvsup.
  3. Use your CVS access (if you have it) to get a local copy.
