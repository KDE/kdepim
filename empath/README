Description:

  Mail client written using the Qt and KDE libraries.
  Designed to be a part of the KDE-PIM (Personal Information Management)
  project.

Features:

  Designed to be fast, sturdy, extensible, and very safe.
  
  'Fast' doesn't necessarily mean 'faster than all other clients'. It
  means Empath won't stall the user interface at any point. This means you
  get to keep working whatever's going on behind the scenes.
  
  Empath doesn't use the most common UNIX mailbox formats, as these are
  completely unsafe. Empath only uses Maildir format mailboxes for local
  mail.

Requirements:

  You will need to use a Maildir format mailbox. Read README.maildir
  for more information.

  To use Empath you need Qt version 2 from CVS and KDE from CVS.
  To get Qt, point your ftp client at ftp.troll.no
  To get KDE libraries from CVS, if you're not already developing for KDE
  you will probably want to get a recent snapshot of the CVS. Look at
  ftp.kde.org for the daily snapshots. Please use a mirror.
  
  Please also note that KDE HEAD branch is under continous development.
  It's easy to end up with a snapshot that's not source or binary compatible
  with Empath as the KDE API isn't yet stabilised. Please talk to Rik if
  you don't understand what this means, and would like advice.

Developers:

  See TODO for what you can help with.

  Please mail me to let me know what you're interested in doing.
  This doesn't have to be coding, it can be providing input for the design of
  the system, writing docs, translating, testing, etc. The more the merrier.

  If you want to help coding, read DESIGN.html
