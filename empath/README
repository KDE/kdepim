Potential developers:

See TODO for what you can help with.

Please mail me to let me know what you're interested in doing.
This doesn't have to be coding, it can be providing input for the design of
the system, drawing icons, writing docs, translating, testing, etc. The more
the merrier.

Obviously the more coders the faster this will stabilise, but I consider the
system as a whole to be important - users will need docs to read, and to be
able to use Empath in their native language.

* GETTING STARTED *

You need:

a) A Maildir, with some mail in it. I suggest using mail from an existing
   Maildir (you can use mutt to do this). Back it up, then put it in place in
   ~/Maildir
   
FOR INFORMATION ON THE DESIGN:

Read DESIGN

Note that the ChangeLog is now a little out of date.
The design_docs stuff is basically me just writing stuff down so that I
understand what I'm doing.
