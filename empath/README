OI !

Developers: Please read DEVELOPER_INFO as well as this.

Note: I have changed things around so Empath _should_ compile with Qt 1.42 and KDE 1.1 libs again. This was done because Qt 2 doesn't seem to be stable enough for me to use as the main test platform just yet. Please remember to code _FOR_QT_2_ but make judicious use of #if QT_VERSION > 200 to select the 1.42 compatible version.

N.B. Empath _will_crash_ if you have use a Qt2 version and then a Qt1.42 version.
This is due to some stream functions reading/writing from ~/Maildir/.empathIndex.
EmpathMaildirIndex is currently using QString, rather than QCString for its
storage. This will change in the future but for now you are warned that if Empath
crashes while trying to read your Maildir, do a quick rm ~/Maildir/.empathIndex
before running.

If it doesn't compile, that's tough. This release is to show people the code
and anyone who gets it to compile (and run) is probably a god. I haven't even begun
to think about making it work outside my box, so good luck :)

If it runs, you'll probably notice you can't do much.

Well, you can, but you need:
a) A Maildir, with some mail in it.
b) A POP host to receive from.

Since I started porting to KDE/Qt 2, things have gone a little awry.

You will find that popping may have undesirable effects, and that YOU WON'T SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING unless you watch stdout. I do empath &> log and read it later as
the speed crashes konsole.

You can just try whacking some mail into your Maildir. Empath might create your
Maildir for you when you first run it. You need to put new mail into ~/Maildir/cur.

Now, the filenames have to be in the canonical format (though Empath should handle
non-canonical names properly). I suggest this:

Get mutt, send mail to some test user, send some replies to that. Pop the mail for that user. Not forgetting to tell mutt your local mailbox is ~/Maildir.

This way you avoid killing your own mail, as you just pop from a test box and write
to a different box.

Of course, Empath might pop your mail and write it to your Maildir, but I doubt it.
It did before the big port started.

Oh, the BeOS style is just there because I started pissing about with Qt2's styles
and wanted to see if it worked. It does.

Anyone who wants to shout at me can not bother. I'm big and from Sunderland.
If you want to help with this project, you'd be very very welcome. I've spent the
last six months working on this full time (that's 12 hours a day, 6 days a week on
average).

I'd love to have a CVS server somewhere. At the moment I use CVS on my local
machine (for practice with CVS).

Anyone who wants to merge this with other projects (Maggelan, KMail ?) I wouldn't
mind. It'd be fun. Let's party.

FOR INFORMATION ON THE DESIGN:

Read Changelog and design_docs/*

Note that the ChangeLog is now a little out of date, and the design_docs are too.
The design_docs stuff is basically me just writing stuff down so that I understand
what I'm doing. With five million things trying to fit into the space for 7, I
get a little unfocussed.
