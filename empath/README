Package: Empath

Version: 1.0 Alpha

Description:

	Mail client written using the Qt and KDE libraries.

Features:

	Designed to be fast, sturdy, extensible, and very safe.
	
	'Fast' doesn't necessarily mean 'faster than all other clients'. It means
	Empath won't stall the user interface at any point. This means you get
	to keep working whatever's going on behind the scenes.
	
	Empath doesn't use the most common UNIX mailbox formats, as these are
	completely unsafe. Empath only uses Maildir format mailboxes for local mail.

Requirements:

	To use Empath you need Qt version 2.0 and KDE from CVS, HEAD branch.
	To get Qt, point your ftp client at ftp.troll.no
	To get KDE libraries from CVS, if you're not already developing for KDE
	you will probably want to get a recent snapshot of the CVS. Look at
	ftp.kde.org for the daily snapshots. Please use a mirror.
	Please also note that KDE HEAD branch is under continous development.
	It's easy to end up with a snapshot that's not source or binary compatible
	with Empath as the KDE API isn't yet stabilised. Please talk to Rik if
	you don't understand what this means, and would like advice.

	Qt's home page is at http://www.troll.no - the home of Troll Tech.
	KDE's home page is at http://www.kde.org - the home of the KDE project.

Developers:

	See TODO for what you can help with.

	Please mail me to let me know what you're interested in doing.
	This doesn't have to be coding, it can be providing input for the design of
	the system, writing docs, translating, testing, etc. The more the merrier.

	If you want to help coding, read DESIGN.html

Getting Started:

	You need a Maildir format mailbox, with some mail in it. I suggest using
	mail from an existing box. You can use mutt to do this. Back it up, then
	put it in place in ~/Maildir/Inbox

	Instead, you could use 'maildrop' to copy your mail to your local Maildir as
	well as your regular box. This way, you get to play without burning your
	mail. This is what I do.
