Potential developers:

See TODO for what you can help with.

Please mail me to let me know what you're interested in doing.
This doesn't have to be coding, it can be providing input for the design of
the system, writing docs, translating, testing, etc. The more
the merrier.

* GETTING STARTED *

You need:

a) A Maildir, with some mail in it. I suggest using mail from an existing
   Maildir (you can use mutt to do this). Back it up, then put it in place in
   ~/Maildir/Inbox
   
   Instead, you could use 'maildrop' to copy your mail to your local Maildir
   as well as your regular box. This way, you get to play without burning your
   mail. This is what I do.
