<P>KNotes is my attempt to write a really usable and good looking 
notes application for the KDE project.</P>
<P>The first stage of the KNotes project has been completed. Most, if not all 
basic functionality has been implemented. The second phase of this project will
consist of attempting to closely integrate KNotes with the KDE desktop in
particular 
kwm and kpanel. Currently this integration has only been achieved in a 
rudimentary fashion. The reason for this is that I have reached the 
boundaries of what can currently be done with the kwm communication protocol. </P>
<P>This brings me to mention the second and more serious reason for implementing
KNotes: to test and extend the kwm communications protocol. It is at present
for example not possible for a KNotes note to remember its position AND virtual 
desktop on exit and place itself exactly on the same position the next time
it is maped onto the desktop. I am currently working with Matthias on this and 
similar problems.</P>
<P>KNotes can:
<UL>
<LI>accept drag and drop (even from a remote ftp site)</LI>
<LI>mail your note</LI>
<LI>print your note ( try it, it looks great )</LI>
<LI>insert the date or a calendar of the current month</LI>
<LI>associate an alarm timer to a note and notify you when the timer expires.</LI>
<LI>have arbitrary colors for background and text</LI>
<LI>have arbitrary sized note</LI>
<LI>use an arbitrary font for a note.</LI>
<LI>do auto-indentation</LI>
<LI>do two different frame styles</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>and remembers all this on a per note basis on exit.</P>
<P>For optimal usage, place the KNotes icon on the kpanel.
To get started, point the mouse pointer on a KNotes note and use the right mouse 
button to bring up the KNotes pop-up menu.</P>
<P>What is your opinion, should KNotes have a simpler window title-bar?</P>

<P>Best Regards

<P>I hope you will enjoy KNotes</P>
