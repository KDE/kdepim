<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Onscreen Fundamentals</A></H2>


<P>KNotes is very simply to use. I am sure that will have no problems with KNotes. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Drag and Drop</A></H2>

<P>KNotes makes use of the KDE Drag and Drop protocol. This means that you can darg
and drop files form the Desktop or kfm or some remote ftp site that you have
open in one of kfm's windows on to KNotes. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Printing</A></H2>

<P>KNotes supports printing. You can
specify the printing command of your choice in the "Set Defaults" tab dialog. 
There exist a number of
printing utilities in the Unix world  which are excellent. It would
make little sense to try re-implement their efforts. Explicitly let me
mention to you the following two printing utilities.</P>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>GNU enscript.</B><DD><P>Markku Rossi has written a powerful reincarnation
of Adobe's enscript ascii to postscript utility. My favorite usage is
enscript -2rG text.txt, but GNU enscript goes far beyond that. Make
sure you have the latest version from 
<A HREF="http://www.hut.fi/~mtr/genscript/">http://www.hut.fi/~mtr/genscript/</A>, or any GNU mirror.</P>

<DT><B>a2ps</B><DD><P>Akim Demaille and Miguel Santana have written a powerful
ascii to Postscript conversion utility which will format your output
depending on the document type. Whether you want to print out C++
sources or a email message, the default styles are very nice. Get
it from:
<A HREF="http://www-inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps.html">http://www-inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps.html</A></P>
</DL>
</P>

<P>The above two utilities are an absolute must. If you don't have them,
get them and become familiar with their usage. Learning how to use
them is no longer a problem due to our great html/texinfo/man viewer
<CODE>kdehelp</CODE>. These utilities are your friends when it comes to printing
in the UNIX world. Due to their power and many options once you know how to use 
them properly, you will always miss them should they ever not be available 
to you, even under Windows95.</P>

<P>Make sure your system is set up for printing PostScript documents. If you
don't have a native PostScript printer ( who does?) get yourself
ghostscript/ghostview version 4.03 or higher  from
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/</A>. Note, that there are now
commercial grade ps fonts available that come with the ghostview/ghostscript
package. These fonts are a must for any quality printing of Postscript documents
on a non-postscript printer. If you were dissapointed by the results you got
from ghostscript on your printer so far - get the new fonts, this
will give you the best possible results. </P>
