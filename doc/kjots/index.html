<H2><A NAME="usage"></A>USAGE:</H2>

<P>Just start kjots from the command line, from kpanel or from a ktaskbar
menu.</P>

<P>It does not take any arguments.</P>

<P>Select 'file-&gt;New Book' to create a new book. Note that the name
of the book has to be a valid filename. So don't insert characters like
'/' into the name.</P>

<P>Open a book from the 'file-&gt;Open book' menu. Then you may create
new pages, delete old ones and scroll through the list of available pages.</P>

<P>With the horizontal scrollbar you may move to other pages very fast.</P>

<P>If you change from one book to another or exit kjots, all changes are
automatically saved.</P>

<H5>Hotlist</H5>

<P>The hotlist is a bar of up to eight pushbuttons. Use them to switch
between the books you need most often. You can add or remove books from
the hotlist by selecting the respective menuentries. The buttons have a
fixed width, so don't use to long names for the books.</P>

<H5>Subjectlist:</H5>

<P>You may give a subject to any page. This subject is displayed in the
statusbar at the bottom of the window. To find a page with a specific subject
you may open a list of all subjects to the currently open book. Just click
on an entry in this list and the corresponding page will be displayed.
If you doubleclick on an entry then the subjectlist window will be closed
instantly.</P>
