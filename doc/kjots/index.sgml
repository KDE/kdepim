<sect>Introduction
<p>
KJots is a small program that helps you to write down some short notes
and organizes them for you.


<sect>Usage
<p>
Just start KJots from the command line or from KPanel.
It does not take any arguments.

Select 'file-&gt;New Book' to create a new book. Note that the name
of the book has to be a valid filename. So don't insert characters like
'/' into the name.

Open a book from the 'Books' menu. Then you may create new pages, delete
old ones and scroll through the list of available pages.

With the horizontal scrollbar you may move to other pages very fast.

If you change from one book to another or exit KJots, all changes are
automatically saved.

<sect1>Hotlist

<p>
The hotlist is a bar of up to eight pushbuttons. Use them to switch
between the books you need most often. You can add or remove books from
the hotlist by selecting the respective menuentries. The buttons have a
fixed width, so don't use names for the books that are too long.

<sect1>Subjectlist:

<p>
You may give a subject to each page. This subject is displayed in the
statusbar at the bottom of the window. To find a page with a specific subject
you may open a list of all subjects to the currently open book. Just click
on an entry in this list and the corresponding page will be displayed.
If you doubleclick on an entry then the subjectlist window will be closed
instantly.
