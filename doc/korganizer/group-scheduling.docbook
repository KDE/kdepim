<title>&korganizer; workshop: Group scheduling</title>

<sect1 id="group-scheduling-overview">
<title>Overview</title>

<para>
Since version 3.0, &korganizer; supports group scheduling. This means
you can use it to organize appointments and meetings as a team. Group
scheduling is based on a peer-to-peer architecture using email as the
communication medium.
</para>

<para>
For example, if you want to organize a meeting, you create the event in
&korganizer; and add all people that should attend by selecting them from
the &kde; addressbook. You can do this by selecting from a &korganizer;
dialog or by dragging an entry from &kaddressbook; and dropping it on
the event in &korganizer;. Then, click on the <guiicon>Request</guiicon>
toolbar button and the event gets automatically sent to all attendees by
email. The recipients get an email containing all the relevant information
for the meeting and, if they have configured &kmail; appropriately,
the event is automatically inserted in their own &korganizer;. They can
respond to the meeting proposal by accepting or rejecting it or by making
a counter proposal. All the information is sent by email again and
the original organizer of the meeting gets information about the event
updated in his/her &korganizer;.
</para>

<para>
Another example: You are playing in a band and, from time to time, you
give live concerts. To notify your fans about the concerts, you maintain
a mailing list. If you use &korganizer; to organize your concert dates,
you can just click on the <guiicon>Publish</guiicon> toolbar button,
put in the address of the mailing list and the event gets sent. Mailing
list subscribers who use &korganizer; get the concert date automatically
inserted in their calendar.
</para>

<para>
Of course, you have complete control over the data that actually get
inserted into your calendar. You can easily reject email containing
calendar information which isn't meant for you or in which you are
not interested.
</para>

<para>
Group scheduling adheres to open standards: iTIP (RFC 2446) and iMIP
(RFC 2447). These are based on iCalendar, the native file format of
&korganizer;. By using these standards, it is possible to exchange group
scheduling messages with users of other applications implementing the
standards, for example, Evolution and Outlook.
</para>

<sect1 id="group-scheduling-setup">
<title>Setting up &korganizer; for group scheduling</title>

<para>
In &korganizer;'s setup, there are two tabs of interest for configuring
group scheduling. In the first picture here, you have to enter your name,
email address and email client properly.
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="gs_setup1.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
<textobject><para>&korganizer; setup</para></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
On the <guilabel>Group Scheduling</guilabel> tab, you can select your
<guilabel>Scheduling mail client</guilabel>. <guilabel>Dummy</guilabel>
is used only for tests and is not useful for end-users. So it's safe
to use <guilabel>Mail Client</guilabel>. The next thing you can select
is whether your scheduling messages should be sent directly or first be
stored in the <quote>Outbox</quote>. We suggest to use
<guilabel>directly</guilabel> if you have a direct internet access,
and <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel> if you use a dial-up connection.
</para>

<para>
The <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel> has the additional benefit of
letting you check your messages before you send them. In the field
<guilabel>Additional email addresses</guilabel> you should add all your
email addresses you use (including aliases). If you receive your email by
using one single email address that is already listed in the first tab,
leave the field blank.
</para>

</mediaobject>

<para>
The last step for setting up group scheduling in &korganizer;
is to enable a filter in your mail client. The filter has to
<quote>pipe</quote> every mail through a small script called
<application>korganizerIn</application>. This script is shipped with
&korganizer; and can be found in the same directory as the &korganizer;
binary (&eg; <filename>/opt/kde3/bin/</filename>). In the picture shown
here, you can see an example for the filter settings for &kde;'s mail
client <ulink url="http://kmail.kde.org">&kmail;</ulink>.

<sect1 id="group-scheduling-organizing1">
<title>Organizing an event using &korganizer;, example #1</title>

<para>
To organize an event for a group, just create an ordinary event and
add all attendees in the attendee dialog.  The easiest way to add an
attendee is to click on the &quot;Addressbook&quot; button and select
one attendee from your &kde; addressbook (&kaddressbook;).
</para>

<para>
<guilabel>Role</guilabel> describes the role an attendee has on this
event, &eg; Participant or Chair. <guilabel>Status</guilabel> informs
you whether an attendee already accepted or declined his participation
on the event. These settings should both be set carefully. Be sure to
set the option <guilabel>Request Response</guilabel> if you want the
attendee to answer your event request.
</para>

</mediaobject>

<para>
When you've added the new event, you can see it with an icon showing a
penguin's head (see the event <quote>Meeting</quote> in the middle of
the picture below). This icon indicates you that you are the organizer
of this group scheduling event.

</mediaobject>

<para>
In order to publish an event, just click on it to mark it, and then select
<guimenuitem>Publish</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Schedule</guimenu>
menu. A dialog will appear, asking for email addresses. Enter all mail
addresses of the people who should attend the your event. After pressing
the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button, the event will either be sent
directly to the recipients or - according to your setting - will first
be placed in the <quote>Outbox</quote>.
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="gs_publish.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
<textobject><para>Publishing an event</para></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
The second way to publish an event is to send a <quote>Request</quote>
to the event's attendees, asking them for a reply. The recipients of your
posting have the choice to accept or to deny the scheduled event. To
publish in this way, just select the event (you must be organizer of
this event) and select <guimenuitem>Request</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Schedule</guimenu> menu.
</para>

<para>
When you've configured &korganizer; to use the
<quote>Outbox</quote>, you can see the event waiting to be sent
out by selecting <guimenuitem>Outgoing Messages...</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Schedule</guimenu> menu. <guiicon>Send messages</guiicon> in the
<quote>Outbox</quote> sends all the messages listed here. You can
also remove queued email by clicking the <guiicon>Remove</guiicon> button.
</para>

<sect1 id="group-scheduling-organizing2">
<title>Organizing an event using &korganizer;, example #2</title>

<para>
After some time, you should receive feedback from the attendees you
invited to the event in example #1. Open the <quote>Inbox</quote>
by selecting <guimenuitem>Incoming Messages...</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Schedule</guimenu>. To be sure to see all incoming messages,
press the <guibutton>Retrieve messages</guibutton> button.
</para>

<textobject><para>The Inbox</para></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
Incoming messages can either be: Reply, Counter, Request,
Publish. If a message is not interesting to you, you can still
reject it by pressing <guibutton>Reject</guibutton> button. Pressing
<guibutton>Accept</guibutton> for a <quote>Reply</quote> event updates
information about the event in your calendar.
</para>

<textobject><para>The Inbox</para></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
Pressing <guibutton>Accept</guibutton> for a <quote>Counter</quote> event
pops up a dialog box with the counter-proposal data. If you accept it,
the event will be updated and sent to all attendees. If you decline it,
your event settings will be retained.

</sect1>

<sect1 id="group-scheduling-attendee">
<title>Being an attendee</title>

<para>
If you receive a new event (<quote>Request</quote> or
<quote>Publish</quote>) you can add it to your calendar by pressing the
<guibutton>Accept</guibutton> button. If the message method chosen by
the sender of that message was <quote>Publish</quote>, nothing more has
to be done by you.
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="gs_inbox2.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
<textobject><para>The Inbox</para></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
If the message method was <quote>Request</quote>, your event has an icon
like the one on the right bottom. This icon indicates that you should
send a <quote>Reply</quote> to the event's organizer.
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="gs_korganizer2.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
<textobject><para>The Reply icon in &korganizer;</para></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
To see all events that need a reply, you can use the <guilabel>What's
next</guilabel> view.
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="gs_whatsnext.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
<textobject><para>What's next?</para></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
Before you send a reply, you should update your attendee data in the
event dialog:
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="gs_attendee2.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
<textobject><para>Attendee dialog</para></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
When you have done so, the event's icon shows three penguin heads to
indicate that you are an attendee of that event. Now you should click
once on the event (to mark it) and select <guimenuitem>Reply</guimenuitem>
from the <guimenu>Schedule</guimenu> menu.
</para>

<para>
If you want to do a counter-proposal, you must change the event's
data, and select <guimenuitem>Counter</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Schedule</guimenu> menu.
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="gs_korganizer3.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
<textobject><para>The Counter icon in KOrganizer</para></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
One other possibility to <quote>Reply</quote> is not to update your
attendee data, but select <guimenuitem>Reply</guimenuitem> and use the
<guilabel>Reply</guilabel> dialog that appears to change your attendee
data.
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="gs_reply.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
<textobject><para>Reply dialog</para></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
If you use the <quote>Outbox</quote>, you can see the <quote>Reply</quote>
message in your <quote>Outbox</quote> ...

<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="gs_outbox2.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
<textobject><para>The Outbox</para></textobject>
