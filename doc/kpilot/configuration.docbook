<title>Configuring &kpilot;</title>

<para>
Once &kpilot; is installed it needs to be
configured
to match your hardware.
The <link linkend="config-conduits">conduits</link>
need to be configured as well.
After that you can use &kpilot;
to synchronize your &PalmPilot; with
your &kde; desktop or view
data from your &PalmPilot; with the
<link linkend="builtin">built-in viewers</link>.
</para>

<para>
When you run &kpilot; from either
the panel menu or from the command prompt for the first time
it will prompt you with
a dialog box to configure it.
This configuration dialog can be requested later
from the main application
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Configure &kpilot;</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
menu, from the &kpilot; daemon popup menu
<menuchoice>
<guimenuitem>Configure KPilot...</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
menu item or by starting &kpilot;
from the shell
as follows:
<screen width="40"><prompt>$ </prompt> <userinput><command>kpilot</command><option>--setup</option></userinput>
</screen>
In addition, if you upgrade &kpilot; and some new configuration
options require your attention, this setup dialog will reappear.

<para>
&kpilot;'s configuration dialog is a large one.
This is because it contains not only the configuration of the
device for communicating with the &PalmPilot;, but also
the configuration of all the installed conduits.
Each group of configuration options
(<link linkend="general-setup">general</link>
and <link linkend="config-conduits">conduits</link>)
will be discussed separately.
We will begin, however, by taking a look at the
<link linkend="configwizard">configuration wizard</link>, which should make most
of the
general group of configuration options superfluous.
</para>

<sect1 id="configwizard">
<title>Using the Wizard</title>

<para>
The configuration wizard helps you to set up &kpilot; to communicate
with the &PalmPilot; and to configure the conduits as a group. It's a great
start for new users, and you can always fine-tune your preferences later.
</para>

<para>
In the <guilabel>Pilot Info</guilabel> dialog, type your <guilabel>User
Name</guilabel>. It
should match the one from the &PalmPilot;. Next, type the file name of
the <guilabel>Device</guilabel> you will use to connect the &PalmPilot; (The
connection can be through a serial port, USB port, infrared, Bluetooth, network
or the generic <filename class="devicefile">/dev/pilot</filename> device.)
Alternatively, click the
<guibutton>Automatically detect handheld and user name...</guibutton>
button and press the &HotSync; button on your &handheld;. The Wizard will try
to find the correct <guilabel>Device</guilabel> and
<guilabel>User Name</guilabel>.
</para>

<important><para>
If the
<guilabel>Device</guilabel> does not have the right permissions, the wizard will
not be able to find it. Normal users must be able to read/write the correct
device. To resolve this issue, please refer to <link

</para>

<para>
&kpilot; interfaces with your &handheld; in two ways: using the
the conduits and the internal viewers. Conduits are plug-in programs which
extend the synchronization capabilities of &kpilot;. &kpilot; stores separate copies of
the databases and records for conduits, while the internal viewers and backup
operation share the same copy. This distinction is important to choose your
update method depending on your usage. If you use mainly the conduits to sync
your &handheld; with external programs, you may choose as default
synchronization method any option that runs the conduits. However, if you use mainly the
internal viewers, you need to update copy of the databases as well in order to
view and edit the information from your &handheld;, so running the conduits only
is not sufficient.

AGConnect application in your &handheld;, click <guilabel>Settings...</guilabel>
and enter your MAL server address, the <guilabel>User Name</guilabel> and
<guilabel>Password</guilabel> you got while registering. The

In the <guilabel>General</guilabel> page, you can set the synchronization
frequency options. It can be  set for <guilabel>Every Sync</guilabel>,
<guilabel>Once per Hour</guilabel>, <guilabel>Once a Day</guilabel>,
<guilabel>Once a Week</guilabel> or <guilabel>Once a Month</guilabel>.
The conduit only runs when you hit &HotSync; on your &handheld;, so
<guilabel>Once per Hour</guilabel>, for instance, really means that
&kpilot; will only try to synchronize with the MAL servers if it is more than an
hour since the last MAL sync.
