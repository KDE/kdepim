<title>Introduction</title>

<para>&knode; is an easy-to-use, convenient newsreader. It is intended to allow
even newbies to use a newsreader under &kde;. &knode; also offers advanced
features appealing to experienced users.</para>

<para>&knode; is an online-reader, but can also, in conjunction with a local
news server, be used as an offline-reader.</para>

<para>If you have problems or questions about this program, please contact the
mailing list for &kde; users (for subscription, see <ulink
url="http://www.kde.org/contact.html">Homepage of the KDE mailing lists</ulink>
) or one of the &kde; newsgroups: </para>

<simplelist>
<member>comp.windows.x.kde</member>
</simplelist>

<para>If you found a bug or have suggestions regarding the functionality of
&knode; please report them via the menu
<menuchoice><guimenu>Help</guimenu><guimenuitem>Report a
bug...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>

<para>Please make sure when asking questions in the above mentioned newsgroups
and mailing lists to only ask questions that are not answered in this
manual.</para>

<para>For those new to reading news and posting articles, I want to recommend
the chapter <link linkend="knode-journey">A journey through Usenet</link>. It is
not so much about the program &knode; as how to move about in the Usenet with
its help. In general, it is not sufficient to just master a news reader for
writing news articles. Imagine a car driver who masters his car perfectly but
does not know about the traffic rules or signs. Do you want to encounter such a
driver when out in traffic? So please take your time to learn at least a little
about the "traffic rules" of the Usenet. The other participants will thank
you.</para>

<tip><para>&knode; supports you in many cases with hints and warnings. If you do
not simply ignore them, you will avoid many beginners' mistakes.  But do not
exclusively depend on them either.</para> </tip>

<!-- Revisions here should be about the *application* not the documentation, -->
<!-- that's handled in the prologue.  I removed this section. -->

</chapter>

<chapter id="using-knode">
<title>Working with &knode;</title>

<sect1 id="first-start">
<title>The first start</title>

<para>You find &knode; in the <guimenu>K</guimenu> Menu under the entry
<guisubmenu>Internet</guisubmenu>. The menu entry
<guimenuitem>KNode</guimenuitem> launches the program.</para>

<tip><para>If the entry for &knode; can not be found or if &knode; should not
appear on the desktop after clicking on the menu entry, read <link
linkend="faq">Questions and Answers</link></para></tip>

<para>The main window of &knode; should now be displayed on your desktop as
shown. On first start, the settings dialog will be invoked.</para>

<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Setting up &knode;</screeninfo>

          </textobject>
	  <caption><para>&knode; after first start</para></caption>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>The windows shows the menu bar, the toolbar below and the status pane at
the buttom. The area between the toolbar and the status pane is occupied by a
three-part windows. </para>

<para>On the left there is a folder view.It currently contains only three
entries.</para>

<simplelist>
<member>Outbox</member>
<member>Drafts</member>
<member>Sent</member>
</simplelist>

<para>When &knode; is completely and correctly configured, the news servers and
the subscribed news groups will appear there.</para>

<para>In the upper-right section, is the article view. It is
currently empty and does not show any articles.  Directly
below the article view, the article window is located. There appears the body of
the currently selected article. These windows are also blank at the moment, as
there are no articles, of course. You should not be
confused because before reading and publishing news, some things have to be
configured first. This will be covered by the following section.</para>

<para>We are now beginning the setting up of &knode;. Most settings are not
important for daily use, but you should know what settings are possible and what
they are for. Some may miss a "Quickstart" chapter but those who prefer a quick
start will just glance over the manual anyway. For others, especially those who
have not any or much experience with a news reader, this chapter offers the
chance to fully perform the configuration, although some things may become clear
only later on. </para>

<sect2 id="setting-your-identity">
<title>Personal settings</title>

<para>Via <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem></menuchoice> you will enter the
preferences dialog of &knode;. The figure shows the dialog.</para>

<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Dialog for entering the personal information</screeninfo>

	  <phrase>Entering the personal information</phrase> 	  </textobject>
	  <caption><para>Entering the personal information</para></caption>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>The dialog is divided into two parts: On the left, there is a treeview, in
which the top entry <guilabel>Identity</guilabel> is already highlighted. On the
right, you see the corresponding input dialog. These settings relate to your
identity with which you navigate through the newsgroups.</para>

<tip><para>If you have already configured your personal settings in the Control
Center before the first start of &knode;, they will be adopted. </para></tip>


<sect3 id="identity-name">
<title><guilabel>Name</guilabel></title>

<para>In the field <guilabel>Name</guilabel> you enter your name,
<abbrev>e.g.</abbrev> <replaceable>Joe Miller</replaceable> or <replaceable>Mary
Gordon</replaceable>. This name will later appear in the newsgroups as sender
and can be seen by anyone. </para>

<para>Filling out the field <guilabel>Name</guilabel> is mandatory. </para>

<caution><para>In most newsgroups, it is considered polite and appropriate to
appear with one's real name. Other newsgroups are less strict about this. But
there are also cases when one would not want to appear with one's real name,
<abbrev>e.g.</abbrev> in newsgroups where one would like to (and can) talk about
very personal matters without being exposed. These groups mostly do tell you in
their Charter that the anonymity of their members is
explicitly approved.</para> </caution>

<tip><para>For those special cases, &knode; offers settings that can be
adjusted to each newsgroup individually. Further
information can be found under <link linkend="group-identity">Group local
Identities</link>.</para></tip>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="identity-email">
<title><guilabel>Email address</guilabel></title

<para>The email adress you enter here will be used as sender in news articles,
<abbrev>i.e.</abbrev> as actual address of the author, in conjunction with the
real name (set in the field <guilabel>Name</guilabel>).</para>

<para>The field <guilabel>Email</guilabel> shows up when someone wants to reply
to you by e-mail. The e-mail will be sent to the address entered here. Many
newsreaders display the sender address together with the name in the
Header of the article. </para>

<para>Filling out the field <guilabel>Email</guilabel>is mandatory.</para>

<tip><para>Note that the e-mail address will only be used for replies to you if
the field <guilabel>Reply-to Address</guilabel> is not filled out. In this case,
the field <guilabel>Email</guilabel> will be ignored for replies and the address
given under <guilabel>Reply-to Address</guilabel> will be used.</para> </tip>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="identity-reply-to">
<title>Reply-to Address</title>

<para><guilabel>Reply-to Address</guilabel> offers you the possibility to enter
a different address than your sender e-mail address. If someone replies to you
by e-mail, this address will be displayed as target address in the reply. An
example for using <guilabel>Reply-to Address</guilabel> would be that you write
the article at the office during the day but want to
receive the answer in your home inbox, because your boss co-reads your
mail.</para>

<para>Only enter an e-mail address in that field if it actually differs from the
field <guilabel>Email</guilabel>. </para>

<warning><para>Some news readers deliberately set this to an invalid e-mail
address in order to prevent spam mails from being received. What could happen
though is that a reader sends an e-mail to this invalid address which you will
therefore never receive.</para> </warning> </sect3>

<sect3 id="identity-organization">
<title><guilabel>Organization</guilabel></title>

<para>The input field <guilabel>Organization</guilabel> is optional and does not
have to be filled out. You can enter <abbrev>e.g.</abbrev> the name of your
company or your university institute, if you use &knode; there. If you leave
this field blank, it will often be filled out later by your Internet
provider.</para> </sect3>

<sect3 id="identity-signature">
<title><guilabel>Use a signature from file</guilabel></title>

<para>If this option is selected, the file specified under <guilabel>Signature
File</guilabel> will be used as Signature.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="identity-sig-file">
<title><guilabel>Signature File</guilabel></title>

<para>The field <guilabel>Signature File</guilabel> determines the file, the
content of which is appended to each of your
articles. The field is only enabled if the option
<guilabel>Use a signature from file</guilabel> is selected.</para>

<para>The signature file is a simple text file, which should not contain more
than four lines. It can <abbrev>e.g.</abbrev> contain a reference to your
homepage with the corresponding link, your postal address with your telephone
number (which would then be of course visible to the whole world with every
article) or just a cool quote.  The
signature is your brand, so to speak, which will mark all
your articles. Therefore your signature should be
designed sloppily or in the long run annoying to others. An old joke that one
would have to read over and over again does not foster sympathy or the interes
of the other newsgroup subscribers.</para>

<para>You can directly enter the file name of the signature file but it is more
convenient to use the button <guibutton>Choose...</guibutton>.  This opens a
file open dialog and you can conveniently choose the signature file with the
mouse. The button <guibutton>Edit File</guibutton> enables you, after choosing
the file, to edit the signature. </para>

<tip><para> It is not neccessary to include a separation line in the signature
file as &knode; inserts it automatically.</para> </tip>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Specify signature below</guilabel></title>

<para>If this option is selected you can enter the text of the
signature directly in the input field below.</para>

<tip><para>Please make sure that in this case also your
signature should not contain more than 4 lines. A
separation line is not neccesary as &knode; inserts it
automatically. </para></tip>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>General notes</title>

<para>You can later adapt the identity individually for each of the subscribed
groups via the <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel> dialog, <abbrev>e.g.</abbrev>
you can specify an English signature for English groups
and a German one for German groups. Apart from the language it is also possible
to have context-sensitive signatures, <abbrev>e.g.</abbrev> your favorite recipe
in a cooking group or the names of your twelve cats in a cat owner group.</para>

<para>You find more in the section <link linkend="group-identity">Group local
identities</link>.</para>

<para>The next step in the configuration covers the news account.</para>

</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="setting-the-news-account">
<title>Configuring the news account</title>

<para>Now we must tell &knode; about where we get the news from or where to send
the articless to later on. In the tree view on the right,
there is an entry <guilabel>Account</guilabel>.  Click on that with the
mouse. Then two sub entries will be opened out. We choose the entry
<guilabel>News</guilabel>, because we first want to configure the news
account. The list of accounts is empty yet.</para>

<para>Therefore we create a new account with <guibutton>Add</guibutton>. The
following dialog appears: </para>

<screenshot>
<screeninfo>The dialog <guilabel>New Account</guilabel></screeninfo>

	  <caption><para>The dialog <guilabel>New Account</guilabel></para></caption>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Name</guilabel></title>

<para>The field <guilabel>Name</guilabel> can be filled out as you like. The
text you enter will later be visible in the folder view. You can
<abbrev>e.g.</abbrev> enter the name of your Internet Provider. For our example
we enter the name <userinput>My News Account</userinput>. </para> </sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Server</guilabel></title>

<para>The next field is labelled <guilabel>Server</guilabel>. Unlike the field
<guilabel>Name</guilabel>, it is not unimportant what you enter here.  The name
of the news server is fixed and should be made public by your Internet
Provider. If you do not know the name of the news server, you should get it
now. Without this information you can not read any news.</para>

<para>For our example configuration we enter the name
<userinput>news.server.de</userinput>. You will of course enter the real name of
your news server.</para>

<tip><para>If you deploy &knode; with a local news server, enter the name
<userinput>localhost</userinput> here! </para></tip> </sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Port</guilabel></title>

<para><guilabel>Port</guilabel>, the next field, has already a default value.
The Port designates, roughly speaking, a data channel, on
which the server listens, whether someone wants to retrieve news. It defaults to
the value 119, which is applicable in most cases.  Therefore we do not change
this default.</para> </sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Hold connection for</guilabel></title>

<para>The time value you enter here is effective if you have established a
connection to the news server and if, for whatever reason, no data is received
from or transmitted to the news server. After the specified time has expired,
&knode; automatically disconnects. This, among other things, relieves the server
of unneccessay connections which reduce its availibilty for other subscribers.
It also makes sure that an automatically established Internet connection is not
held unnecessarily although no data is being sent or received. </para>

<tip><para>This settings mainly makes sense if one receives and reads news
online. For local news servers it is of almost no importance. If this waiting
time is set too low, there can be waiting periods if you read a longer
article and do not do "anything" for some time. &knode;
has cancelled the connection to the server by then after the period has expired
and has to reestablish it. </para>

<para>If this waiting time is set too high, you perhaps waste online time when
doing nothing. </para></tip>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Timeout</guilabel></title>

<para>If &knode; connects to the news server, it waits no longer for an answer
of the news server than the time that is set here. If this period is exceeded,
you will get a corresponding error message, because the server does not respond
and &knode; cancels the connection attempt.</para>

<tip><para>Depending on the quality of your Internet account and the news
server's current load. there can be waiting periods, so that &knode; cancels the
connection. If this happens frequently, you should set this setting to a higher
value.</para></tip>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Fetch group descriptions</guilabel></title>

<para>If this setting is selected, &knode; additionally requests the available
group descriptions. They will be displayed in the dialog <guilabel>Subscribe to
Newsgroups</guilabel>.</para>

<tip><para>There is not a group description for every group, so there is no
error if no group description is shown when subscribing to a group later
on.</para> </tip>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Server requires authentication</guilabel></title>

<para>The option <guilabel>Server requires authentication</guilabel> needs only
to be selected if your news server requires a user name and a password when
retrieving articles. If this is the case, you will find out from your Internet
provider or the server's maintainer. </para>

<tip><para>If you do not know exactly if this setting is necessary, forget about
selecting it. If you encounter an error later on, you still can select it
then. Otherwise select this option and enter your user name under
<guilabel>User</guilabel> and the associated password under
<guilabel>Password</guilabel>. </para> </tip>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>General notes </title>

<para>By now you have completed the setup of your news account. Via the button
<guibutton>Subscribe</guibutton> you can perhaps directly get to the dialog for
subscribing to news groups. But we still have more to do and ignore it for
now. There are several ways that lead to the goal. </para>

<para>You confirm and save your settings by clicking on the button
<guibutton>OK</guibutton>. As soon as you have done that, the account will
appear in the list by the name that you have entered in
<guilabel>Name</guilabel> before. And if you have a close look, you will see
that the account is also appearing in the folder view. </para>

<para>In the chapter <link linkend="multiple-news-accounts">Managing
multiple news accounts </link> you will learn how to work with multiple
news accounts. But first, we will stay with this one. In most cases, one
account is sufficient. </para>

<caution><para>Please note that some Internet providers only allow retrieving
news if you are logged on via this provider. </para></caution>

<para>We will now move on to configuring the e-mail account. In order to do
that, click on the entry <guilabel>E-Mail</guilabel> in the tree view on the
left. </para></sect3>

<sect2 id="setting-the-mail-account">
<title>Setting up the mail account</title>

<para>After selecting <guilabel>Mail</guilabel> in the tree view, the following
Dialog Box appears on the right.</para>

<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Dialog Box for setting up the mail-account</screeninfo>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="knode-mail-account.png" format="png">

	<phrase>Dialog Box for setting up the mail-account</phrase>
	  </textobject>
	  <caption><para>Dialog Box for setting up the mail-account</para></caption>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>You will notice this Dialog Box to be very simmilar to the news account
settings Dialog Box. But why do we need an e-mail account in a
newsreader?</para>

<para>Sometimes you need to anwser to the author of an article directly, without
posting to the newsgroup. For example, when you want to make a very personal
comment or want to correct an error. Sometimes a dialog is more appropriate than
a public remark.</para>

<para>Thats why &knode; provides the posssibility to reply by e-mail.  If you
want to use this feature, you must tell &knode; how to send e-mails. You just
need to insert the mailserver. When you have already configured an e-mail
account, <abbrev>i.e</abbrev> with <application>KMail</application>, you can
reuse the settings used there.  </para>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Server</guilabel></title>

<para>The name of your mailserver is not arbitrary. Your <abbrev>ISP</abbrev>,
should provide you the informations, which mailserver to use. All you have to do
here is to enter the mailserver in the <guilabel>Server</guilabel> field.</para>

<para>In our example we enter <userinput>mail.server.de</userinput></para>

<tip><para>You can send your mail by a local mailserver. When you use a local
mailserver, use <emphasis>localhost</emphasis> in the
<guilabel>Server</guilabel> field.</para>

</tip>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Port</guilabel></title>

<para>Again, the <guilabel>Port</guilabel> field has a default value.  In this
case it Port 25. You should not need to change this, despite your ISP has a very
exotic configuration nad tells you to do so.  We do not change this for the
example.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Hold connection for</title>

<para>This value is important, after you established a connection with your
mailserver. If there is no data transfer, &knode; cancels the connection to your
mailserver after this amount of time.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Timeout</guilabel></title>

<para>When &knode; tries to connect to the mailserver, it waits this long for a
reply by the the server. Is this time execceded, you get a error message.</para>

<tip><para>Depending on the quality of your connnection and the actual load of
your mailserver, you can get long reply times. If &knode; cancels the connection
due to this, you should increase the timeout.</para></tip>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>General remarks</title>

<caution><para>Some ISP only allow you to send e-mail over their mailserver 
after you checked your mailbox on new mails. This reduces spamming.</para>

<para>For same reasons, some ISP only allow you to send mail by their
mailservers, when you are onine with this ISP.</para>

</caution>

<para>In the next step we look at the general settings for reading news.</para>

</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="setting-news-general">
<title>General News Settings</title>

<para>Now click on <guibutton>Read news</guibutton> and then on the subentry
<guibutton>General</guibutton>. The picture shows the dialog and the preferences
you can configure there.</para>

<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Dialog General Preferences</screeninfo>

	</textobject>
	  <caption><para>The dialog General Preferences</para></caption>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>You don't need to change most of these settings, but we will discuss them
step by step to give you an overview over the possibilities of &knode;.</para>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Check for new articles automatically</guilabel></title>

<para>If this box is checked, &knode tries to request new
articles from the server when selecting a newsgroup.
These settings especially make sense when you use &knode; together with a local
news server. Downloading the messages obviously only works when the server is
reachable. For a server which is only reachable via an Internet connection, this
setting rarely makes sense and should stay deactivated.</para>

<para>If your system isn't set up to establish an Internet connection if
neccessary, you will get an error message each time you select a
newsgroup.</para>

<para>If you want to keep control over when a connection to the server is
established, the menu option <guimenu>Group</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Get new
articles</guimenuitem> is appropriate.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>max to fetch</guilabel></title>

<para>This sets the restriction of the articles, which are requested from the
server while downloading. The value configured here is for each
Newsgroup seperately. Set this for instance to 300, so
that only the 300 newest articles of the newsgroup are
requested. Other articles are discarded!</para>

<warning><para>Please notice: For newsgroups with relatively high traffic you
might lose articles if this value is too low. This especially occurs when you've
just subscribed to a newsgroup or download
articles only occasionally and the traffic for this
reason rises above the value specified here.</para></warning>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Mark article as read after</guilabel></title>

<para>Articles you have opened in the article window are marked as read after
the number of seconds specified here. If you set this value relatively high, you
avoid that an articles you just glanced at is directly marked as read. On the
other hand it can be annoying for relatively short articles for which you need
less time to read than specified. If you browse in this case too fast through
the articles they stay, although you've read them
already, unread. Therefore, you should adjust this value to your personal
preferences.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Show whole thread on expanding</guilabel></title>

<para>This setting lets discussion be displayed completely (over multiple answer
levels, that is). If this setting isn't checked, only the immediate answers to
the current article are displayed.</para>

</sect3>

<para>If this setting is activated, the <glossterm>signature</glossterm> of the
sender is displayed in the article window, if it isn't, the
signature is surpressed.</para>

<caution><para>Please notice that &knode; can display the signature correctly
only if it can be seperated correctly from the article content in the current
article. There are newsreaders which do this seperation incorrectly. Two "-"
with a following "&nbsp;" (space) are correct. </para>

</caution>

<tip><para>Many participants in the newsgroups give hints on their homepage or
intentionally erroneous specified E-Mail adresses in the header in the
signature. If you disable displaying the signature, you might loose those
information. On the other hand you might save yourself from reading stupid

<title><guilabel>Show attachments inline if possible</guilabel></title>

<para>If this setting is marked, &knode; tries to display the contents of

<para>Additionally, you have the possibility to save the attachment or open it

of the attachment by using the context menu.</para>

<para>Articles which are sent as Multipart <acronym>MIME</acronym> contain the

<title><guilabel>Header</guilabel></title>

<para>The selection box <guilabel>Header line</guilabel> shows the entry
<guilabel>From</guilabel>. That is the name of the header line for the sender,
as it's actually present in the article and evaluated by
the newsreader. If you drop down the selection box, &knode; shows a range of
other identifiers, which stand all for a certain header line in the
article. For now, we'll leave the identifier
<guilabel>From</guilabel> configured. We'll work with this list later, when we
add a header line to the display.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Displayed Name</title>

<para>This field holds the name, which is later shown in the article window as a
replacement for the actual identifier of the header line. For the header line
<guilabel>From</guilabel>, it's the <guilabel>sender</guilabel>.  If you leave
this field blank, only the content of the header line appears in the article
window. This is for example the default setting for the header line
<guilabel>Subject</guilabel>. We won't change anything here either.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Name</title>

<para>Here you can influence the attributes of the shown name with the
checkboxes. In our case, the attribute <guilabel>Bold</guilabel> is selected for
the name <guilabel>Sender</guilabel>, <abbrev>i.e.</abbrev> the text will be
shown in bold letters in the article window. Of course, you can combine
different attributes, for example <guilabel>Bold</guilabel> and
<guilabel>Underlined</guilabel>.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Value</title>

<para>The information given for <guilabel>Name</guilabel> is true for these
checkboxes as well, but these attributes are associated to the content of the
shown header line, in course case to the actual sender. You can later see the
effects of these settings in the displayed articles. For example, select here
the entry <guilabel>Italic</guilabel>, and the sender, <abbrev>i.e.</abbrev>
"John Doe &lt;johndoe@doubleguns.com&gt;" appears in a italic font.</para>

<para>It would be nice if one could see which newsreader another subscriber uses
in the article window. Well, that's pretty easy because there's actually a
(optional) header line which contains that information.</para>

<para>Drop down the selection field <guilabel>Header line</guilabel> and select
the entry <guilabel>X-Newsreader</guilabel> from the list.</para>

<para>In the field <guilabel>Shown name</guilabel>, enter
<userinput>Newsreader</userinput>.</para>

<para>Now you can select any attribute for the display of the field and it's
content. Next, acknowledge your input with the <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.  The
new header line appers now in the list and will later be shown in the article
window.</para>

</example>

<para>Use the <guibutton>up</guibutton> and <guibutton>Down</guibutton> buttons
to arrange the order of the headers in the article window.</para>

<tip><para>The statement that the new header line will be shown in the article
window is actually pretty optimistic, because the entry X-Newsreader isn't
required for Usenet artciles. Therefore, not all articles will contain that
header line. If the line doesn't exist, the according entry simply won't be

<caution><para>The Message-ID must be unique worldwide! There will be collisions
between messages with the same Message-ID, otherwise.  The newsserver will
reject the second article, because it thinks, this article was already
recieved.</para>

<para>A Message-ID consists of a valid FQDN (Full Qualified Domain Name).  This
means it looks similary to an e-mail adress with a indentification befor the @
and the domain.  </para>

<para>The identification is generated by &knode; automatically, but you must
provide a valid domain name in <guilabel>Hostname</guilabel> When you do not
have your own domain, you should not activate this option.  Let the newsserver
generate a Message-ID for you.  </para>

<emphasis>kde.org</emphasis>. A Message-ID gernerated with this
domain will look like:
</para>
<para>934lek9934@kde.org</para>
</example>
</para>

<para>An uniqe identification is only guarenteed, when you have your own
domain. Even when you do not use &knode; for generating your Message-IDs there
may be collisions, when you are using a local newsserver.  For example
<application>leafnode</application> generates a Message-ID which it derives from
the local hostname.  </para> </caution>

above this would be: <userinput>kde.org</userinput></para> </sect3>

<para>After some time, &knode; has fetched the list of available newsgroups and
shows them in the left window <guilabel>Groups on</guilabel> in a tree view.
This tree view shows the newsgroup-hierarchy.</para>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Groups on</guilabel></title>

<para>This list shows all newsgroups on this server. If you check one of the
checkboxes <guilabel>subscribed only</guilabel> or <guilabel>new only</guilabel>
you get the corresponding selection.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Current changes</guilabel></title>

<para>The window<guilabel>Current changes</guilabel> shows all changes you made,
since you opened the dialog.</para>

<para>The list <guilabel>subscribe to</guilabel> shows the newsgroups you have
choosen to subscribe.</para>

<para>Below you see the list <guilabel>unsubscribe from</guilabel>. This list
shows all newsgroups you have choosen to unsubscribe. You can not unsubscribe
from groups you didn't first subscribe to.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>subscribed only</guilabel></title>

<para>If <guilabel>subscribed only</guilabel> is checked, the tree-view
<guilabel>Groups on</guilabel> shows only the groups you are already subscribed
to. This is very convenient, if you want to unsubscribe from some groups.  You
don't have to search the whole tree for these groups.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>new only</guilabel></title>

<para>If <guilabel>new only</guilabel> is checked, the tree-view
<guilabel>Groups on</guilabel> shows only the groups, wich are new since you
last fetched the group-list. For this to be functional, you first have to fetch
a new group-list with <guibutton>New List</guibutton></para>

<para>The button <guibutton>New Groups</guibutton> give the possibility to show
show all new groups since a specific date.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Filter</guilabel></title>

<para>The second and most likely used possibility to navigate in the tree is the
input field <guilabel>Filter</guilabel>.  &knode; filters the groups according
to your input with every keystroke. If you are searching for a group around KDE,
but you do not know the exact position in the hierarchy, just type
<userinput>kde</userinput> in the <guilabel>Filter</guilabel>-field.</para>

<para>When you enter the <userinput>k</userinput>, you will already see the list
changing. The second letter, <userinput>d</userinput>, give you a significantly
reduced list of shown groups, and the final <userinput>e</userinput> reduces the
list to the groups with kde in their name. In the US you will most likely end
with just one group.
<simplelist>
<member>comp.windows.x.kde</member>
</simplelist>
</para>

<para>This incremental search gives you the possibility to search for newsgroups
without knowing the exact path.</para>

<tip><para>On a close look, you will see &knode; showing the groups without a
tree if there are only a few groups left. This is not a bug, it is a
feature. </para></tip>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guibutton>New List</guibutton></title>

<para>The button <guibutton>New List</guibutton> tells &knode; to fetch a new
group list from the newsserver.</para>

<para>The newsgroup-hierarchy is in a constant flux. All the time there are
groups introduced, renamed or moved. Some groups just disappear, they are no
longer available and get deleted. To reflect this, &knode; gives you the
possibility to refresh the the group list. This is, normally, only needed to see
if your server now provides a group which was not there before.</para>

<tip><para>If you simply want to make sure to see every new group, it is more
effective to use <guibutton>New Groups</guibutton>. Fetching the complete list
is much more time consuming, but you make sure the deleted groups vanish from
the grouplist.</para></tip>

<para> Unfortunately there is no guarantee that your newsserver is providing all
available newsgroups. Many newsserver refuse groups publishing binary
attachments. Other groups are only available from special servers.  &knode;
provides you the possibility to use more than one news-server, if you want to
acces alternative servers providing these groups. You can read more about this
in <xref linkend="multiple-news-accounts">.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>New Groups</guilabel></title>

<para>This button opens a dialog wich allows you to configure the list of new
groups. You can choose between showing all groups since the last refresh or all
groups since a given date. With the date option, &knode; provides a more
flexible posibility to check for new groups. You can even check for new groups
before the last refresh of the grouplist.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Working with the dialog</title>

<para>We now want to subscribe to the KDE-group. Mark the the box on the left of
the name. You can now see the group in the list <guilabel>subscribe
to</guilabel>. Another posibility is to use the arrows between the two
windows.</para>

<para>If you picked the wrong newsgroup by mistake, you can undo your selection
by unchecking the checkbox next to the groups name in the <guilabel>Groups
on</guilabel> window. Again you can use the arrow. You probably noticed the
arrow changing his direction.</para>

<para>If you want to unsubscribe from a newsgroup it is as easy as to subscribe
to it. You just uncheck the box next to its name. The groups you unsubscribed
from are shown in the list <guilabel>unsubscribe from</guilabel>. Again the
arrow is another way for doing things.  For correcting your actions you can use
the arrow again.  This works as long as the dialog is not closed by clicking
<guibutton>OK</guibutton>.</para>

<para>As a KDE and &knode; user you will probably want to subscribe to the
group.  So make sure you checked the box and press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.
This group now appears in the tree-view under the server entry it was choosen
from. In our example this is <emphasis>My News Account</emphasis>. If you can
not see the group, click on the cross next to the server entry or on the server
entry itself. The list of subscribed newsgroups should appear.</para>

<para>Click on the newsgroup. Now you see on the right in the article view an
empty folder. &knode; has to fetch the articles for the new newsgroup.  When you
have in <menuchoice><guimenu> Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem> Preferences
</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Reading news </guimenuitem><guimenuitem>
General</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, the check box <guilabel>checking for new
article automatically</guilabel> checked, &knode; trys to fetch the articles
from the server, when the newsgroup is first selected. If this is unchecked, you
have to use <menuchoice> <guimenu>Account</guimenu> <guimenuitem> Get new
articles</guimenuitem> </menuchoice></para>

<important><para>When you are using <application>leafnode</application> as an
server, there will be a single article in the
group. <application>leafnode</application> generates an article in every new
subcribed group.  This indicates <application>leafnode</application> will
consider this group the next time it fetches articles. You can ignore an error
message saying the article can not be found. If you select this article you tell
<application>leafnode</application> you are really interested in this
group.</para>

<para>You get the real articles, when your local newsserver fetches them from
the Internet and provides them to you. Details about this you can find in the
documentation of your local newsserver.  </para> </important>

<para>When everything worked, the articles of the subscribed newsgroup appear in
the upper right window, the article view.</para>

</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="fetch-and-read-news">
<title>Fetching and reading Articles</title>

<para>&knode; always shows three views (folder view, article view and article
window). You can change height and width of these views with the mouse.  If you
click in a window it gets the focus. This is important, if you want to use
&knode; with the keyboard. The <keycap>Tab</keycap> key changes the focus
between the views. The currently active view is indicated by a small colored
bar over the coloum headers.</para>

<title>The folder view</title>

<para>The folder views contains not only the accounts you configured - in our
example this is <emphasis>My News Account</emphasis> - but also three other
folders. When you already subscribed to some newsgroups ther will be cross next
to the accounts name. Clicking on the cross or the name of the account opens the
tree.</para>

<tip><para> Using the right mouse button you get a context menu for the selected
item (folders or newsgroups). If you select a newsgroup and choose Properties,
you can, among other things, specify your identity for this particular
group. You can find more about this in <xref
linkend="group-identity"></para></tip>

<para>When you select a newsgroup with your mouse, a list of articles of this
group appears in the upper right window. If there are no articles in the upper
left window, there are two posibilities. There are no articles for this
newsgroup on the newsserver or the newsserver did not fetch them yet.  Select
<menuchoice> <guimenu>Account</guimenu> <guimenuitem> Get new
articles</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>.  If there are still no articles appearing,
you have some problems with your settings or there really are no articles for
this group. Try another group.  If there are no articles for this group, you
most likely have to work through the first chapters, about the configuration of
&knode;, again.  The chapter <link linkend="faq">Frequently Asked
Questions</link> may help you, too.</para>

<caution><para>If you are using a local newsserver, the articles only appear if
the newsserver already got them from the internet. When you are using
<application>leafnode</application> this is done by the the program
<application>fetchnews</application>.</para> </caution>

<sect4>
<title>The newsgroup folders</title>

<para>The newsgroup folders appear with the name the are given by the hierarchy
on the newsserver. In our exapmle this is
<guilabel>comp.windows.x.kde</guilabel>. You can change the name shown in this
view. In the context menu (<mousebutton>right</mousebutton> mouse button on the
newsgroups name) choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>Properties</guimenu> </menuchoice>
then you can change the name in the inputfield <guilabel>Nickname:</guilabel>. A
good name for <guilabel>comp.windows.x.kde</guilabel> would be for eample
<guilabel>The KDE-Newsgroup</guilabel>.</para>

<para>If you leave the input field empty, the hierarchical name is
shown.</para>

<para>Besides the name of newsgroups the folder view shows much more
informations by the appearance. When there are new articles in a group or
folder, the name is shown bold. The columns <guilabel>Total</guilabel> and
<guilabel>Unread</guilabel> tell you how many articles are in the according
group or folder and how many are marked as unread.  </para> 

</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>The folder <guilabel>Sent</guilabel></title>

<para>Selecting this folder shows you the articles you succesfully sent,
including your e-mail replies. You can delete the messages in this folder, but
this has no influence on the messages already sent. </para>

<caution><para>If your are using a local newsserver, an article appearing in the
folder <guilabel>Sent</guilabel> only indicates the local newsserver receiving
the article. It is possible this article never appears in any newsgroup, because
the local newsserver was not able to send it for some reason.  If you notice
some article not appearing in the according newsgroup, first make sure it was
sent by the local newsserver.</para></caution>

want to sent an article later, choose <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu>
<guimenuitem> Send Later</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> in the editor. The article
is then filed in the <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel> folder. It is possible to edit,

<para>You can navigate in articles, display an article and open or close threads
with your mouse or keyboard. </para>

<para>When you select an article with your mouse, its entry in the the article
view gets colored. At the same time the header and body of this article appear
in in the article window. If you want to read an other article, you can use the
mouse for selecting it or you can use  the cursor keys. When you use the coursor
keys, you can move the dashed frame to the article you want and then press Enter
for marking and diplaying the article. </para>

<para>There are many key commands, wich allow a comfortable navigation in a news

<title>Sorting and filtering of articles</title>

<para>Some newsgroups are very crowded and contain lots of articles.  Perhaps
only some of them are interesting to you. One possibility to keep track is
sorting your articles with certain criterias.</para>

<para>Sorting your articles and the choice of sorting criterias is done with the
column titles in the article view. Clicking on a cloumn title makes it the
current sorting criteria. Another click on the same coloumn title changes the
order of sorting.</para>

<tip><para>The current sorting criteria is indicated with an arrow next to the
titel.  This gives you an easy sign, wich column is used for sorting, too. You
have to make the coloumn wide enough, so that you can actually see the arrow.
You can change the coloumn width by moving the mouse pointer on the small area
between two column titles. The pointer changes it's appeareance in two horizontal
arrows. Click and hold <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> mouse button allows you
now to change the width of the column left to the mouse pointer.</para></tip>

<para>&knode; gives you the posibility to reduce the flood of articles. You can
show only the articles fitting in your specific criterias. &knode; uses filters
for this task. In this paragraphs we are just dealing with the predefined
filters. For defining and using your own filters, please refer to the chapter
<xref linkend="using-filters"></para>

<para>Normally you will read most articles only once, and then never again.
&knode; labels the articles which are unread, but when there are more articles
in a news group than can be shown by the article view, you often have to search
for unread articles. It would be much easier to see only the new fetched and
unread articles. &knode; gives you this feature by the predefined
filters.</para>

<para>In the status line at the bottom border of your main window behind the
word <guilabel>Filter</guilabel> the actually active filter is shown.  If you do
not change the filter configuration, this is the filter
<guilabel>all</guilabel>. This means all articles of a newsgroup are shown.
<guilabel>all</guilabel> is one of the predefined filters. There are eight of
them, wich are described in more detail here.</para>

<guilabel>From:</guilabel>-adress, &knode; opens an editor window. The e-mail
adress of the author and the subject of the refering article are already filled
in for you. This enables you to reply to the author directly from her
article. </para>

<para>The appeareance and content of the shown header shown by default can be
	  configured by choosing <menuchoice>
<guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem>
<guilabel>Reading News</guilabel>
<guilabel>Headers</guilabel>
</menuchoice>
You can find a more detailed view on this in <xref
linkend="knode-headers"></para>

<para>
By selecting
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>View</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Show all headers</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
you force &knode; to show the whole header as it is produced by the
newsreader and newsservers. Normally you do not need this view, becaus it
needs a lot of space in the article window.
</para>

<para>The last lines of the header contain, if necessary, some references to
other articles, shown as numbers in the range from 1 to n. These References are
articles refering to the current article. The article labled with 1 is the
oldest article. This means it is the first one refering to the current
article. The article with the highest number is the one the current article is
refering to.</para>

<para>When you click on a reference, the according article is loaded and shown
in the article view. It can occure, &knode; is telling you, the refered article
is no longer reachable. This always happens when an article is older and the
article management of &knode; or your newsserver decided to delete it from the
newsgroup. How to get such an article, please refer to the <link
linkend="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</link>.</para>

</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>The body of the article</title>

<para>The body of the article follows straight after the header.  This is the
actual message, the author published in the newsgroup. Be aware of an article
possibly containing quotes from other articles, which are not always
recognizable as quotes. This depends on the newseditor and the habits of the
author.</para>

<para>&knode; provides some highlightings, wich are used in the article window.
At the moment these are:

<simplelist>
<member>/italic/</member>
<member>*bold*</member>
<member>_underlined_</member>
</simplelist>
</para>

<para>Do not use the highlighting too often. With increasing use of it, the
impact decreases.</para>

<para>Most of the time a quote is indicated by a prefixed &gt; on every
line. There are other possible signs. If you can not directly recognize a quote,
the author did not obey the rules of proper quoting.</para>

<para>Furthermore it is usual to start an anwser with a introductionary
line.</para>

<para>Something like:
</para>
<informalexample>
<para> On 12/25/2000 Santa Claus wrote:</para>
</informalexample>

<tip><para>Normally you do not have to bother with these introductionary lines.
&knode; does this automaticaly, when you reply to an article. How to configure
this line, you can read in chapter <xref

<para>In <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem> <guilabel>Reading News </guilabel>

<caution><para>&knode; provides smart colouring of quotes, but at the moment,
only quotes starting with &gt; are coloured.</para></caution>

<title>The signature</title>
<para>
Below the main text of an article, you find the signature of the author.
Provided you did not turn this behaviour off in
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem>
<guilabel>Reading News</guilabel>
<guilabel>General</guilabel></menuchoice>
The signature is divided from the text by thin, horizontal line.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>Attachments and multipart-mime messages</title>

<para>If an article contains attachment, they are shown below the signature in a
table.</para>

<para>The multipart-mime format allows to send the body of an article in more
than one format. For example in plain-text or <abbrev>HTML</abbrev>. It depends
on the newsreader which format to provide for reading the article. </para>

<para>&knode; allows showing the different formats by selecting
<menuchoice>

When this option is checked, all alternative formats are sown as
attachments and can be opend and viewed like them.

<title>Writing and replying to articles</title>

<para>Before you start writing article or replying to other Usenet users, be
sure you understand the habits in the current newsgroup. Again, reading <xref
linkend="knode-journey"> would be a good idea.</para>

<para>For testing the Settings of &knode; please resist sending an article to a
random newsgroup. It is not very friendly to bother people with test
articles. What if you are subscribed to a newsgroup and half of its articles are
only containing the word <quote>test</quote>? This is like somebody calling you
just for testing her phone.</para>

<para>This is the reason for the special groups having <quote>test</quote> in
their name. An example is: <emphasis>alt.test</emphasis>. In these groups you
can test everything you want, without bothering somebody. Some groups even send
you error messages back. </para>

<para>You can find a selection of test groups in
<link linkend="infos-testgroups">Test Groups</link></para>

<para>Subscribe to one of the test groups now. Some newsservers have their own
test groups, which are probably less crowded. </para>

<tip><para>Remember, you have to download the articles of the new subscribed
group.  Perhaps there are many articles in these groups, so it will take some
time to fetch them the first time. The only important articles are yours and the
anwsers by the check handler. If you want to reduce the amount of fetched
articles during the test.  you can configure this in
<menuchoice>
 <guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
  <guilabel> Preferences</guilabel>
   <guilabel> Reading News</guilabel>
    <guilabel> General</guilabel>
     <guilabel> max to fetch</guilabel>
</menuchoice>
If you reduce this dramatically, you should not wait too long for fetching the
new articles after sending your test article. You article can be a vicitim of
your limitations.  A tolerably fast newsserver, should provide your article
right after you sent it.  Feel free to send another article, if can not see you
initial one. This is what the test groups are for. </para></tip>

<caution><para>When you are using a local newsserver, the configuration of
<guilabel>max to fetch</guilabel> in &knode; is useless. You should consult the
documentation of you newsserver instead.</para></caution>

<para>If you did not encounter any errors, unsubscribe from the testgroups and
set <guilabel>max to fetch</guilabel> back to normal (1000).</para>

<sect3>
<title>Publishing articles</title>

<para>You have seen a big part of &knode; now. You used &knode; passively so
far, so lets get to some action. We will publish a test article now.  Select the
new subscribed test group in the folder view.  With <menuchoice>
<guimenu>Article</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Post new article</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> or the key <keycap>P</keycap>, the Editor is called.
</para>

<para>You can use the &knode;-Editor like a normal Texteditor.  There are some
additional features for writing news articles.</para>

<para>When you look at the editor window, you see two input lines.  One for the
subject, which is empty at the moment, and another for the newsgroups this
article is going to be posted to.</para>

<para>Enter the text <userinput> This is a test </userinput> in the subject
field.</para>

<tip><para>When you post an article, use a descriptive subject. Articles without
a descriptive subject are often ignored. Avoid subjects like <quote>Help, it
doesn't work !!!!!</quote> This subject gives no information about the content
of your article.</para></tip>

<para>The <guilabel>Groups:</guilabel> field already contains the test newsgroup
you selected befor. Do not change this.</para>

<para>The features provided by the Check Box and Combo Box below the input
fields mentioned above, are not used in this test. Please refer to <link
linkend="knode-editor-advanced">The Editor</link> for further

<para>For simplicity reasons we only use a simple sentence. Type:</para>

<para><userinput>This is the body of my test article. @ $ %</userinput></para>

<para>Enter an empty line, followed by.</para>

<para><userinput>Did it work?</userinput></para>

<para>This may look funny to you, but it does what it is supposed to do,

<menuchoice>
 <guimenu>File</guimenu>
  <guimenuitem>Send Now</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> in the Editor.
If you do not have a connection to a newsserver at this point,
you may want to send the article later. You can achieve this by using
<menuchoice>
 <guimenu>File</guimenu>
  <guimenuitem>Later</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>.
&knode;, then, stores this article in the folder <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel>.
You can start sending the articles in the <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel> manually,
by selecting
<menuchoice>
 <guimenu> File</guimenu>
 <guimenuitem> Send pending messages</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>.
</para>

<para>After sending the article you will notice &knode; stored a copy in
the folder  <guilabel>Sent</guilabel>.</para>

<para>Depending on how fast your article is published in the according
newsgroup, you can check the result after some time. Mostly it is sufficient to
check for new messages immediately after sending the article. Be patient it
<emphasis>may</emphasis> take the article some hours before reaching the
newsgroup. If the article does not arrive after some hours, most likely,
something went wrong. Try again. If it is still not working, have a look at the
<link linkend="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</link></para>

<important><para>Even when you are using a local newsserver, you have to check
for new articles. The local newsserver just sends the article, it does not store
it in the local newsgroup. So you have to synchronise with an external
newsserver, if you want to see if your test article arrived.</para></important>

<para>When the article shows up in the newsgroup, you were successful. Check the
<guilabel>From: </guilabel> line and the readability of the articles body.  If
everything is ok, you succesfully used &knode; to send your first
article.</para>

<title>Post Reply</title>

<para>After succesfully publishing an article, we will now anwser to your
own article. You want to anwser the question you asked, don't you?</para>

<para>Select your article in the article view and press the right mouse button.
You see a context menu, where you choose <guimenuitem>Post
reply</guimenuitem>.</para>

<para>&knode; opens the Editor again, but this time there is already a subject
filled in for you. The subject line reads:</para>

<para><emphasis>
Re: This is a test
</emphasis>
</para>

<para><emphasis>Re: </emphasis> is a shortcut for the latin <quote>In
re</quote>, which means something in the lines of "relating to". You should not
change the subject and above all the <emphasis>Re: </emphasis>. Most newsreaders
sort threads by the subject.</para>

<tip><para>If you want to change the subject for some reason, put the new subject
in front of the old and  replace the Re: with a parenthesized (Was: ... ). In our example
this would look like</para>

<informalexample>
<para>A new subject! (Was: This is a test)</para>
</informalexample>

<para>With this kind of subject you show the other readers, there is a branch in
the original discussion. This happens, when a new topic occurs in the original
discussion or the original subject changed for some reason.</para>

<para>If you anwser to an article with such a subject, delete the parenthesized
part of the subject. The first part with a prefixed <emphasis>Re:</emphasis>
remains.

<informalexample>
<para>Re: A new subject!</para>
</informalexample>
</para>
</tip>

<para>Let us have look at the Editor now. The contents of the article, we want
to reply to has already been copied to the Editor by &knode; To indicate the
text is a quote, every line is prefixed with a <emphasis>
&gt;</emphasis>.</para>

<para>In front of the quoted text, &knode; has put a introduction line.
The content of this line refers to the original author.
You can change the standard text of this line in

</para>

<para>The original article contains the question:
<emphasis>Did it work?</emphasis>
We want to anwser this question now.
</para>

<para>Place the cursor below the quoted question and write in the next
line:</para>

<para><userinput>Yes it worked, congratulations!</userinput>
</para>

<para>We are not finished now. It is considered polite to begin with
greeting like <quote>Hello</quote> in the first line. If you call the atuthor by
his name or not, depends on your habits. Watch the newsgroup to get used to the
habits there.</para>

<para>Next we delete all not mandatory parts of the quoted article. In our case,
we delete all parts, except the question. </para>

<para>With such a short text this is unnecessary, but this just an example.  If
you have to read a message 100 lines long, again, just to find a <citation>"I
agree"</citation> at the end, you will understand.  Aside from this, articles
get smaller and use less space on the server.</para>

<title>Mail Reply</title>

<para>The Mail Reply follows the same lines as posting a reply in a newsgroup.
The Mail Reply is sent directly to the author and does not apear in any
newsgroup. This is the only difference.</para>

<para>Sometimes it is better to use an emailed reply instead of posting a reply
to newsgroup.  Primarily, when you want to correct an error or misconduct by the
author, without hurting his feelings by doing this publicly on the
newsgroup.</para>

<para>For answering with an e-mail, you select your article, again, open the
context menu with the right mouse button, and choose <guimenuitem>Mail
Reply</guimenuitem>.  &knode; opens the Composer with the quoted article.</para>

<para>Subject and body are identical with posting an article, but the
<guilabel>Groups:</guilabel> field is replaced by a <guilabel>To:</guilabel>
field. Here appears the authors e-mail adress.  In our example this should be
your own e-mail adress, if &knode; is set up correctly.</para>

<para>For e-mails apply the same rules for quoting and politness apply as for

<para>Sooner or later, you will start searching for one specific article.
The &knode; search feature is an easy way to do so.</para>

<para>You can reach the search function by selecting<menuchoice>
<guimenu>Article</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Search</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> or the <keycap>F4</keycap> key.
The screenshot below shows the Search Dialog Box.
</para>

	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>The Search Dialog Box has three tabs, which allow several
search criteria. The first tab contains the settings for the criterias
<guilabel>Subject</guilabel> and <guilabel>From</guilabel>. The second tab
contains the Settings for the <guilabel>Status</guilabel> of an article.
Additional contains the criteria, wich do not belong to the first or
second tab.
</para>

<para>You propably already noticed the similarities between the Filter Dialog Box
and the Search Dialog Box. The usage is the same and should not be too
complicated, if you already defined your own filters. </para>

<para>&knode; always searches in the currently active newsgroup.  A search in
all newsgroups is not possible at the moment.  After the Search finished, the
articles found appear in the article view.  When you close the Search Dialog
Box, When you close the Search Dialog Box with <guibutton>Close</guibutton> the
search results are deleted, and the old view of the newsgroup appears
again.</para>

<sect3>
<title><guilabel>Start Search</guilabel></title>
<para>With this button you start the Search with the search
criteria you defined. All articles in the selcted newsgroup,
fullfilling this criterias, appear in the article view.
</para>
</sect3>

<para>This button resets all search criteria.

<sect2 id="supersede-and-cancel">
<title>Supersede and cancel articles</title>

<para>This chapter deals with superseding and canceling articles.  You will not
use this two features very often, but they belong to the comfort features of a
newsreader.</para>

<caution><para>Both functions need a newsserver beeing able to handle them.  And
you should remeber that there is no guarantee, that no one has already read your
article, before it is superseded or canceled.</para>

<para>So first think, then post.</para>
</caution>

<sect3>
<title>Cancel</title>
<para>Canceling an article means deleting it from the newsgroup.
</para>

<para>Why should you want to cancel an article?  Well, perhaps you falmed
somebody in a rage and now you want to get this article out of the newsgroup,
because you regret what you wrote.  A personal insult, read by everybody, looks
not too good, especially when you regret it. So there is only one thing, cancel
the article.</para>

<para>Select the article you want to cancel and choose
<guimenuitem>Cancel</guimenuitem> in the context menu.  When you are sure it is
the right article, confirm &knode;s question with
<guibutton>Yes</guibutton>. Now you are asked if you want to send the Cancel
message now or later. For this example we decide to send it
<guibutton>Later</guibutton>. You will notice the new message in the folder
<guilabel>Outbox</guilabel>.</para>

<para>Now we want to look at the so called cancel message.  In the subject you
will find something like:</para>

<para><emphasis>cancel of &lt;n177m8.1m.ln@konqui.org&gt;</emphasis></para>

<para>This strange letters between the brackets are the
Message-ID of the article, you want to cancel.
This message tells the newsserver to delete your article.
When you look at complete header of this message by selecting
<menuchoice>
 <guimenu>View</guimenu>
 <guimenuitem>Show all headers</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
you will notice a line with the name <emphasis>control</emphasis> and the
content <emphasis>cancel &lt;xxxxx@ddddd.dd&gt;</emphasis> This line tells the
server, this message is a control message. In our case, this message cancels
your article.</para>

<para>You can still delete the control message from the
<guilabel>Outbox</guilabel>.</para>

<caution><para>Keep in mind, an article can only be identified by his
Message-ID.  You need this Message-ID if you want to cancel an article. Normaly
your article gets this Message-ID when it arrives at the newsserver.  Thats why
you can only cancel an article, when it is already published.  The articles in
the folder <guilabel>Sent</guilabel> have no Message-ID, so you can not cancel
them from there.</para>

<para>There is one exception. If you have configured &knode; to generate a
Message-ID, you can cancel you articles in folder <guilabel>Sent</guilabel> ,
too.</para>

<para>&knode; allows only to cancel your own articles. It refuses to cancel
articles from other authors.</para>
</caution>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Supersede</title>

<para>Supersede overwrites your article with a new version.  One reason for
doing this could be:</para>

<para>You have written a long article and already posted it.  Now you find an
error in this article. You can cancel this article and post a new, corrected,
article. Or you can use Supersede.</para>

<para>Select this article in the article view. In the context menu, select
<guimenuitem>Supersede</guimenuitem>.&knode; will ask you, if you really want to
overwrite this article. Confirm with <guibutton> Yes</guibutton> and the
Composer appears.</para>

<para>In the Composer you can now make the wanted corrections and changes.  You
can publish this article in the same way as you post every other article.  When
the newsserver recives this article, it reads some special lines in the header
which tell the newsserver to supersede the older article.  Select
<menuchoice>
 <guimenu>File</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Send Later</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> for now, because we want to look at the articles header in
the <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel>.
</para>

<para>
Activate
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>View</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Show all headers</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>, because we want to see all the header, the newsserver recives.
You will notice a line like:
</para>

<para>
Supersedes: &lt;oggcm8.4n5.ln@konqi.org&gt;
</para>

<para>This is the instruction for the newsserver for superseding the article
with the Message-ID &lt;oggcm8.4n5.ln@konqi.org&gt; with the new article.</para>

<para>Besides this Supersede is used for periodical posted
articles, <abbrev>i.e.</abbrev> <acronym>FAQ</acronym>s. The new article
supersedes the old one and the newsgoups do not end up with lots of different
versions. </para>

<caution><para>Again, using this function is only possible, if the article
already has a Message-ID. Normally articles get their by the newsserver.  This
means, you can only supersede articles, which are already published.</para>

<para>you can configure &knode; to generate this message, then you can supersede
your articles in the <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel>, too.</para>

<para>&knode; allows only to supersede your own articles.</para></caution>

</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="score-watch-ignore">
<title>Score, watch, ignore</title>

<para>Score, watch and ignore are only different names for the same
feature.</para>

<para>By scoring a thread, you determine its importance. &knode; allows scores
between 0 and 100. A normal article will get a score of 50 if you do not change
this. So threads with a score below 50 are less important and threads with a
score above 50 are more important than the average.</para>

<para>The score is an attribute of the thread and the articles in this thread.
So you can use the score for filtering and searching articles.  For example, you
can define a filter, which shows only articles with a score &gt; 50.</para>

<para>The function <guilabel>Watch</guilabel> only sets the score of all article
in a thread to 100. So they get the highest possible score and &knode; labels
them with a special icon.</para>

<para>The function <guilabel>Ignore</guilabel> does the opossite.  Ignore scores
all articles with 0 and does not show this articles anymore.</para>

<para>In this version &knode; only allows the scoring of threads.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="group-identity">
<title>Group identities</title>

<para>With &knode; you can use a different identity with every newsgroup you are
subscribed to. This involves name, e-mail, reply-to adress and signature.</para>

<para>It is easy to set group identities. For setting up a group identity,
select the according newsgroup. In the context menu, select
<guimenuitem>Settings</guimenuitem>. The second tab is identical with the global
identity settings. Confirm your settings with <guibutton>OK</guibutton> and your
articles in this group are always posted with this identity.</para><caution>

<para>When you unsubscribe from a group, you lose the identity settings for this
group. If you resubscribe to this group, you have to repeat the settings. For
new newsgroups, the global identity is used.</para></caution>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="multiple-news-accounts">
<title>Managing multiple news accounts</title>

<para>&knode; can handle a unlimited number of news server accounts in addition
to your main news server. Most users don't need this feature, but it can be very
handy to if your main newsserver doesn't provide all groups you want to
read. Typical cases are support groups for commercial software that are hosted
on a special server or binary newsgroups.</para>

<para>In order to add an new account, you have to open the preferences dialog via
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem>
<guilabel>Accounts</guilabel>
<guilabel>News</guilabel>
</menuchoice>
The button <guibutton>New</guibutton> creates a new account, you then have
to enter the same data as for your first account, typically a name for the
account, the host name and user name / password combination if the server
requires authentication. When this is done the new server will appear both
in the configuration dialog and in the group view. You can now subscribe to
newsgroups.</para>

<para>You can delete the currently selected account by pressing the
<guibutton>Delete </guibutton> button.</para>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>I have installed KDE2, but &knode; does not exist in the
<guimenu>K</guimenu> Menu.</para></question>

<answer>
<para>Does the Entry <guisubmenu>Internet</guisubmenu> exist? If not, maybe you
didn't install the kdenetwork package because your distribution possibly doesn't
do this for you. If the entry is there, but you don't have an item
<guimenuitem>KNode</guimenuitem> in it, you should try to open a
<application>Konsole</application> and run &knode; from there. Type</para>

<screen width="40">
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput><command>knode</command> <option>&</option></userinput>
</screen>
<para>If an error message appears that tells you that &knode; could not be
started or found, please check whether the file <filename>knode</filename>
exists in <filename class="directory">$KDEDIR/bin</filename> and its permissions
are correctly set. </para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>When I start &knode;, a message appears in the task bar but
suddenly disappears without &knode; being started.</para></question>

<answer><para>Try to start &knode; from the <application>konsole</application>
(see previous question) and keep attention for the messages displayed there. If
those don't look obvious to you, mark them with your mouse and copy it to the
clipboard. Turn to a &kde; mailing list or use another news reader to ask for help
in a &kde; news group.</para></answer>

</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>I need an important article, but &knode; doesn't have it any
more. Where do I find this article?</para></question>

<answer><para>You can find some extensive usenet archives at
www.deja.com/usenet/ or AltaVista. They even contain several years old
articles.</para>
<!-- well, they do when they're not broken, like deja is now -->
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>How do I open and read several articles at the same
time?</para> </question>
<answer>
<para>Open the article with <guimenuitem>Open in own
window</guimenuitem>. </para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>My articles don't appear in the news group.
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>When you publish an article it may last some time
until your news server has it. Wait several hours before you send the
Article again. 
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>I want to keep some article. How do I archive
it?</para> </question>
<answer>
<para>
Choose the article in the article view. <menuchoice>
<guimenu>File
</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Save
</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> opens a file dialog. You can save the article to a file now.
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>Some set headers don't appear for several articles in the article window.
Am I doing something wrong?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>This is not unusual because many headers are optional and often not
contained in articles. In this case &knode; doesn't show those header
lines. </para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>Sometimes I see an article which refers to other articles but &knode; does
not show any references Why's that? </para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
This happens when somebody posted an article in another news group and checked
the option <guilabel>Followup To</guilabel>. This article is sent to your news
group but the referring article is absent. In many cases the poster tells the
reason for his choice to set a followup.
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>When I want to answer an article,
an error message appears telling me that the external editor could not be
started; but the editor is correctly set.
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Have a look whether you entered the place-holder for a filename
after the editor command. If not, enter it. If you &eg; want to use
<application>kedit</application>
enter
</para>
<para>
<userinput><command>kedit</command> <token>%f</token></userinput>
</para>
<para>If the <token>%f</token> is absent, your editor can not be run.

<title>A journey in the World of Newsgroups</title>

<para>This chapter is supposed to glance over the World of Newsgroups and their

some strange customs, wich may give you a feeling of being a lonely alien
without backup.  But stay calm, it is not like this. The Usenet is a meeting

<title>... newsgroups?</title>
<para>
You can look at newsgroups as public bulletin boards and forums, where evereybody
is allowed to participate. Articles you have published in a
newsgroup can be read by everybody subscribed to this newsgroup. And normally
everybody is allowed to publish her articles in a newsgroup.

<sect1 id="nettiquette">
<title>Online Manners</title>

<para>There are lot of different people meeting and talking in newsgroups.  It
is seen as some kind of courtesy to obey some rules of manner, Some basics are
listed here.</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem> <para>Before you ask questions be sure you read the
newsgroups <acronym>FAQ</acronym> (Frequently Asked Questions) and didn't find
the anwser. </para> </listitem>

<listitem>
<para>If you take part in a discussion, be aware the fact, everybody can read the
anwser.  Say nothing you wouldn't say to the others when you were facing them.
Avoid insults.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Try to avoid crosspostings.  Do not ask a question in
more than one newsgroup when you don't know which is the right one.  Ask in one
newsgroup. If it is wrong, you are told which is right one.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Formulate your articles accurately. Nobody likes to read
an article with lots of typos, even with content worth a Pulitzer. Think of your
articles as letters.  Your letter speaks for you, it represents you. Somebody
reading your article will draw conclusions about you from it, wrong or right.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Remember, nobody sees your grin when you are writing an ironical
sentence. It may be funny for you, but it can be very serious for the one
reading it. It is very difficult to include emotions in an article. </para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>The most important rule: Use your common sense when you are anwsering or
publishing an article. </para> </listitem>
</orderedlist>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="usenet-slang">
<title>The Usenet language</title>

<para> You won't be surprised about English beeing the main language on the
Usenet.  There are special trees with German (de.*), French (fr.*) and many
other languages.  If you are unable to determine the main language of a
newsgroup, the only possibility is careful listenening or a possible explanation
in the description of the group in the grouplist.  </para>

<para>In addition over the time the Usenet developed his own language,
but  happily it is easy to learn.</para>

<sect2>
<title><acronym>RTFM</acronym> and other typos</title>

<para>When you read news, after some time you will read some strange
combinations of letters. For example you can get a reply like:</para>

<!-- LW: This should be a variablelist, but I don't think there's time to change
before committing for Release.  We can fix for next version -->

<para>
RTFM
</para>

<para>
Nothing else. Strange but absolutely intended.  To solve the riddle: Those, most
of the time, are shortcuts, acronyms.  It is easier to drop some letters, than
writing the same sentence over and over again.
</para>

<para>
But what is the meaning of <acronym>RTFM</acronym>?  The writer demands you, to
read the manual, documentation or <acronym>FAQ</acronym> before asking questions
in the newsgroup. Clearer: (R)ead (T)he (F)ucking
(M)anual. <acronym>BTW</acronym> an advice you should adopt.
</para>

<para>
Wait, what is <acronym>BTW</acronym> now? Another often seen acronym which means
(B)y (T)he (W)ay. It is easy when you know it. Now, for you not to be
continously speculating over acronyms there is table at he end of this section,
containing the most often used aconyms. ;-)
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Smile!</title>
<para>
Again such a strange thing. What is this ;-) meant to be? Turn your
head so the left side of your Screen is on top. Got it?
You spot the smile with a wink?  This is a so called emoticon. Emoticons are
an often used possibility to express  mimic. One thing missing in conversation
on the Usenet. (But there is a susbstitute, remember? ;-)
</para>

<para>
It is very diffcult to express emotions in emails or news. Your joking comment
can be very serious for the recipient and can lead to unmeant reactions or conflicts
(flames). So use emoticons to express your intention.
</para>

<para>There are a lots of emoticons, which express a great variety of emotions.
You will see, the interpretation is easy  if you turn your head and think of a face.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>PLONK!</title>

<para>
This PLONK! looks like some comic-sound, doesn't it? And that is
exactly what it is used for. The one who reads it knows he was just added to the
killfile of a newsreader. Normally this means the recipient
of the PLONK! ticked off the sender. The PLONK!  plays back the sound of the
recipients name hitting the ground in the <glossterm>killfile</glossterm>. The
sender turned his back to the recipient.

</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="acronyms">
<title>Often used acronyms</title>

<para>When you are reading your news with &knode, you will really soon see some
strange combinations of letters in the <glossterm>articles</glossterm>.
For a novice user it is difficult to guess the meaning of all the acronyms used.
That's why we provide you a list
of the most often used acronyms. This table is in no means complete. ;-) It is
based on a list originally provided by Martin Imlau.

<title>Compile and install</title>

<para>&knode; is part of the package kdenetwork of KDE 2.x and is installed
together with it. so in general, there is no need for a user to compile the
sources of &knode;. If you nonetheless intend to or if you only have the sources
available, compilation and installation is done, as is custom on Linux, by
typing: </para>

<screen width="40">
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput><command>./configure</command></userinput>

<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput><command>su</command></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput><command>make</command> <option>install</option></userinput>
</screen>

<para>&knode; uses <application>autoconf</application> and
<application>automake</application>, so there should be no problems during
compilation. But if so, please contact the already mentioned mailing list or the
KDE newsgroups. </para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="configuration">
<title>Configuration</title>

<para>If you use &knode; together with with a local news server, you must make
sure that this server is correctly set up and started. For further details,
please consult the documentation of your local news server. </para>

<tip><para>The availability of the local news server can easily be verified with
the program <application>telnet</application>. Open a console and type:</para>

<screen width="40">
<prompt>%</prompt> <command>telnet localhost nntp </command>
</screen>

<para>Followed by that, the news server should respond with:</para>

<screen width="40">
<prompt>%</prompt>

Escape character is '^]'.

<para>You quit the <application>telnet</application> session with:</para>

<screen width="20">
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>quit</userinput>
</screen>

<para>If that should not work, there is either no local news server set up or
the server was not started. In this case, please consult the documentation of
your local news server.</para> </tip>

<para>Further, you need of course a (dial-in) connection to a news server on the
Internet. From there, &knode; or the local news server retrieves the
articles. Your Internet provider should be able to give
you information about which news servers you can use. You need this information
in any case.</para>
