<para>If you want to successfully install &knode;, you need a &kde;
3.x. If, in addition, you want to use &knode; as an offline
newsreader, you need a local news server, &eg; <ulink
url="http://www.leafnode.org"><application>leafnode</application></ulink>.</para>

<title>Compile and install</title>

<para>&knode; is part of the package kdenetwork of &kde; 3.x and is
installed together with it if you have chosen to install the
kdenetwork package. So in general, there is no need for a user
to compile the sources of &knode;.</para>

<para>Since version 0.2 the format of the configuration files and the
saved articles has changed. An update is not readily
possible. Unfortunately, your old configuration files can not be
imported.</para>

<para>If you update from a version >= 0.4 the local folders will
automatically be converted into the new format. You can't use this
data with an older version of &knode; any more!</para>
