<H3><A NAME="sec-Customizing"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Customizing Kmail </A></H3>

<P>Kmail's settings window gives you a number of ways to customize Kmail to your needs.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Identity Tab</A>
</H3>

<P>The settings in the <B>Identity</B> tab are fairly straightforward. The <B>Name</B>
and <B>Organization</B> fields should contain the appropriate information if you want this
information to be automatically included in the headers of any message that you send.
The <B>Email Address</B> and the <B>Reply-to Address</B> field should contain your email address. 
The <B>Signature File</B> field contains the location of your signature file. You can skip setting the 
signature file if you do not have one. If you do this, make sure that you also uncheck <B>Automatically
Append Signature</B> in the <B>Composer</B> tab.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Network Tab</A>
</H3>

<P>The <B>Network</B> tab contains the settings that tell Kmail how to send and receive your
email. Many of these settings can vary greatly depending on the setup of your system
and on the kind of network that your mail server is located. If you do not know what
setting to pick or what to put in a field, consult your Internet Service Provider
(ISP) or System Administrator.
<P> 
The <B>Sending Mail</B> section provides two options for sending mail:
sendmail and SMTP. Sendmail has a reputation of being difficult to set up, so if you
do not already have a working sendmail configuration, choose SMTP and fill in the
<B>Server</B> field with the name and domain of your mail server. You will probably
not need to change the <B>Port</B> setting.
<P>To set up an account so you can receive mail, press the <B>Add...</B> button in the
<B>Incoming Mail</B> section. You will then be prompted for the type of account.
Most users should select <B>POP3</B> unless you have a setup where some other
program is already retrieving your mail into a mail file. After pressing
<B>OK</B> you will be presented with the <B>Configure Account</B> window.
First, fill in the <B>Name</B> field to name your account. <B>Login</B>,
<B>Password</B>, and <B>Host</B> should be filled in with the appropriate
information from your ISP or System Administrator. Again, you should not need to
change the <B>Port</B> setting. Select <B>Delete mail from server</B> if you
don't want to leave your mail on the server. Finally, you can set the default
box to received your new messages. 
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Appearance Tab</A>
</H3>

<P>The <B>Fonts</B> section allows you to change the type and size of the display fonts in the <B>Main</B> 
and <B>Composer</B> windows. 
<P>The <B>Layout</B> section lets you toggle the long folder list on and off.  The long folder list lists
folders all the way down the left side of the screen, which lets you see many more folders than in the
default view, but it takes away some space for viewing the text of your message. 
<H3><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Composer Tab</A>
</H3>

<P>The <B>Phrases</B> section lets you define the automatically generated lines added to message replies, forwarded
messages, and quoted text. There are special %-denoted characters that will insert certain values. These
are shown at the top of the Phrases section: %D to insert the date, %S to insert the subject, %F to insert
the sender, and %% to insert a percent sign. The <B>Indentation</B> field contains the character that
will denote quoted text.
<P>The <B>Appearance</B> section lets you control various options for your messages. <B>Automatically Append
Signature</B> and <B>Automatically Sign Messages</B> let you toggle whether to automatically include
your signature and PGP signature in all of your messages by default. <B>Word Wrap At Column</B> lets you
turn word wrapping on and off in the <B>Composer window</B> and lets you set the column at which words will be
wrapped.
<P>
<P>
<P>The <B>When Sending Mail</B> section lets you customize how and when messages are sent.
<P>The <B>Default Sending options</B> lets you define what happens when a message is sent. If <B>send now</B> is
selected, the message is sent to the mail server immediately, while if <B>send later</B> is selected,
the message is queued in the <B>outbox</B> to be sent later with the <B>File | Send Queued</B>
command or automatically when you check your mail, depending on the settings in the <B>Misc</B> tab.
<P>The <B>Send messages options</B> let you select how your message will be encoded when it is sent. <B>Allow 8
bits</B> means that Kmail will send your message in 8 bit ASCII, which means that all special characters
such as accented letters will be sent as-is.  If <B>MIME-compliant (Quoted-printable)</B> is selected,
then special characters will be encoded using standard MIME encodings, which may be more portable to
other mailing systems than 8-bit ASCII.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Misc Tab</A>
</H3>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Empty Trash On Exit</B><DD><P>The trash folder is cleared of messages when you quit Kmail if this option is
selected.
<P>
<DT><B>Send Mail in outbox folder on Check</B><DD><P>All messages queued in the outbox folder will be sent whenever you check your mail.
</DL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 PGP Tab</A>
</H3>

<P>This tab controls the PGP features. At a minimum, you must fill in the <B>PGP identity</B> field so that Kmail
can properly interface with PGP or GNU Privacy Guard.
