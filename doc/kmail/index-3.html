<H2><A NAME="s3">3. How to get started...</A></H2>

<P>This will be a very short introduction to kmail and its usage so you can start
working with it right away! For more in depth information see the Features section.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 KMail's first invokation....</A></H2>

<P>Invoking kmail for the first time it will create a Directory and some files
in your home directory. 
This is the "&nbsp/Mail" directory which holds the initial folders (outbox,sent-mail,trash 
& inbox).</P>

<H3>Ok,looks good...what now?</H3>

<P>The main screen is devided into 3 parts:</P>
<P>1. The folder widget (upper left widget).</P>
<P>2. The mail header widget (upper right widget).</P>
<P>3. The reader widget (lower widget).</P>
<P>Clicking a folder will open it and display the messages in the header widget.
Most likely there won't be any messages visible on kmail's first start.
Clicking one of the headers will make the message appear in the reader widget.</P>

<H3>Setting up kmail</H3>

<P>Please select "Settings" from the "File" - menu. In this Tabdialog you now have to 
enter some initial information so kmail can work correctly. In addition you can  
specify some preferences to adjust kmail to your needs.</P>
