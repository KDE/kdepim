<sect>Introduction<label id="sec-Intro">

<p>
The Kmail Team welcomes you to Kmail, a user-friendly mailer for the
K Desktop Environment. Our goal is to make a mailer that is beautiful and intuitive
without sacrificing power. 
<p>
If you have never set up an email client on a Unix system before, we suggest that you read through 
the <ref id="sec-GettingStarted" name="Getting Started"> section first so that your setup goes smoothly.
<p>
Bug reports and suggestions should go to one of the <ref id="sec-Developers"
name="developers">. <p>
We hope you will enjoy Kmail!
<p>

<sect>Getting Started<label id="sec-GettingStarted">
<p>
This is a short introduction to Kmail and its usage so you can start
working with it right away. For more in-depth information see the 
<ref id="sec-UsingKmail" name="Using Kmail"> section.
<p>
Invoking Kmail for the first time creates a Mail directory containing the initial
files (inbox, outbox, sent-mail, and trash) in your home directory.  Kmail then pops up
the Settings window where you must enter some initial information so Kmail will 
be able to properly retrieve and send your messages. 
<p>
The Settings window consists of six tabs: <bf>Identity</bf>, <bf>Network</bf>, <bf>Appearance</bf>, 
<bf>Composer</bf>, <bf>Misc</bf>, and <bf>PGP</bf>. 
To begin sending and receiving email you will only have to change the
settings in the <bf>Identity</bf> and <bf>Network</bf> tabs.

<sect1>Setting your Identity
<p>
The settings in the <bf>Identity</bf> tab are fairly straightforward. Fill in the <bf>Name</bf>
and <bf>Organization</bf> fields with the appropriate information if you want this
information to be automatically included in the headers of any message that you send.
Next, fill in the <bf>Email Address</bf> and the <bf>Reply-to Address</bf> field 
with your email address. Finally, set the location of your signature file in the
<bf>Signature File</bf> field. You can skip setting the signature file if you do not
have one, but every time you compose a new message, Kmail will ask you for your
signature file.
<p>
<sect1>Setting up your Account
<p>
The <bf>Network</bf> tab contains the settings that tell Kmail how to send and receive your
email. Many of these settings can vary greatly depending on the setup of your system
and on the kind of network that your mail server is located. If you do not know what
setting to pick or what to put in a field, consult your Internet Service Provider
(ISP) or System Administrator.

<sect2>Sending Mail
<p> 
The <bf>Sending Mail</bf> section provides two options for sending mail:
sendmail and SMTP. Sendmail has a reputation of being difficult to set up, so if you
do not already have a working sendmail configuration, choose SMTP and fill in the
<bf>Server</bf> field with the name and domain of your mail server. You will probably
not need to change the <bf>Port</bf> setting.

<sect2>Receiving Mail
<p>
To set up an account so you can receive mail, press the <bf>Add...</bf> button in the
<bf>Incoming Mail</bf> section. You will then be prompted for the type of account.
Most users should select <bf>POP3</bf>. (IMAP accounts are not supported) After
pressing <bf>OK</bf> you will be presented with the <bf>Configure Account</bf>
window. First, fill in the <bf>Name</bf> field to name your account. <bf>Login</bf>,
<bf>Password</bf>, and <bf>Host</bf> should be filled in with the appropriate
information from your ISP or System Administrator. Again, you should not need to
change the <bf>Port</bf> setting. Finally, select <bf>Delete mail from server</bf> if
you don't want to leave your mail on the server. Leave the account's mailbox set to
inbox for now, although you may want to change it if you add more accounts later.
<p>
You are now ready to send and receive mail!

<sect1>Testing Your Setup
<p>
First, we will send an email to test our configuration. To send an email, hit 
Control-N, or select the <bf>File | New Composer</bf> menu item.  The <bf>Composer</bf> 
window will appear. Fill in the <bf>To:</bf> field with your email address and type
something in the <bf>subject</bf> field.  Send the mail by selecting <bf>File | Send</bf>.
<p>
To check your email, select <bf>File | Check Mail...</bf> A window will pop up and indicate how much mail is being 
downloaded. If you receive the message you just sent, then congratulations!
 If, however, you receive any error messages
while testing your setup, make sure that your network connection is working and
recheck your settings by selecting <bf>File | Settings...</bf>

<sect>Using Kmail<label id="sec-UsingKmail">

<sect1>The Mail Reader Window
<p>
The <bf>Mail Reader</bf> window is the window that appears when Kmail is started. The <bf>Mail Reader</bf> window 
is divided into three panes:
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>Folders Pane (upper left pane)</tag>
This pane contains a list of your message folders. (other email programs call them 
mailboxes) To select a folder, simply click on it. The messages contained in the folder
will now appear in the Headers Pane. The folders can be displayed in both a short view, which takes up only
a small portion of the left side of the screen, and a long view, which takes up the entire left side of the
screen but is able to show more mailboxes. See the <ref id="sec-Folders" name="Folders Section"> 
for more information about how to use folders.  
<p>
<tag>Headers Pane (upper right pane)</tag>
This pane lists header information (message Status Flags, Sender, Subject, and the Date the message 
was sent) for the messages in the currently selected folder. Clicking on a header will
select that message and display it in the Message Pane. You can also select a series of
messages by clicking on one message, holding down the SHIFT key, and clicking on
another message. The two messages you just clicked on will be selected, along with all
the messages in between. You may sort the messages by clicking on the column that you wish to
sort.
<p>
<tag>Message Pane (lower pane)</tag>
Displays the header and body of the currently selected message. You can scroll through
the message page by page using the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys, or line by line using the up and
down arrow keys. You can also use the following key shortcuts to skip through your 
messages without having to use the mouse:
<itemize>
<item>N or the left arrow key - Next message
<item>P or the right arrow key - Previous message
<item>+ - Next unread message
<item>- - Previous unread message
</itemize>
</descrip>

Messages can have several status flags, which can be changed from the <bf>Message | Set
Status</bf> submenu. The status flags are described below:

<itemize>
	<item><bf>New:</bf>(red dot, message colored red) The message has been received for the first
	time and is unread.
	<item><bf>Unread:</bf> (green dot, message colored blue) The message has already been retrieved off
	the server at least once, but has not been read yet.
	<item><bf>Read:</bf> (dash) The message has been read. 
	<item><bf>Replied:</bf> (blue u-turn arrow) A reply has been composed to this message. 
	<item><bf>Queued:</bf> (envelope) The message has been queued in the <bf>outbox</bf> to be sent later.
	<item><bf>Sent:</bf> (angled envelope) The message has been sent. 
</itemize>
<p>

<sect1>The Composer Window
<p>
The <bf>Composer</bf> window is used to write new messages. It can be invoked from the <bf>File</bf> Menu or from the
document icon on the <bf>Mail Reader</bf> window button bar. If you have not set the location of your signature
file and you have <bf>Automatically Append Signature</bf> checked in the <bf>Composer</bf> tab of the
<bf>Settings</bf> dialog, you will be prompted for the location of your signature file before the <bf>Composer</bf> window opens.


<sect2>Composing a Message
<p>
To write your message, fill in the appropriate fields in the <bf>Composer</bf> window.  There are a variety of
shortcuts to help you with writing you messages.  The ellipses buttons next to the <bf>To:</bf>,
<bf>cc:</bf>, and <bf>Bcc:</bf> fields will call up the addressbook so that you can select addresses
from there instead of trying to remember them. When you are finished with your message, hit the Send
button (the envelope) to queue or send the message.

<sect2>Attachments
<p>
You can attach files to you message by using one of the methods below:
<itemize>
<item>Push the paper clip button and select the file you wish to attach.
<item>Drag a file from the desktop or another directory into the <bf>Composer</bf> window.
<item>Selecting one of the options in the <bf>Attach</bf> menu.
</itemize>
<p>
The <bf>Message Part Properties</bf> dialog will appear to prompt you for information about your 
attachment. The mime-type and file name fields are automatically filled in with the appropriate values.
You should then select an encoding method for your file from the list of encoding options. 
<p>
Once a file is attached to your message, it appears in the Attachments pane at the bottom of the
<bf>Composer</bf>
window. You may remove, save, or get information about an attachment by selecting its line in the
Attachments pane and selecting <bf>Remove</bf>, <bf>Save</bf>, or <bf>Properties</bf> from the
<bf>Attach</bf> menu. 
<p>
PGP keys may also be attached to your message by using the appropriate options in the <bf>Attach</bf>
menu. PGP key attachments are handled like file attachements.
<p>
<sect2>Checking the Spelling of you Message
<p>
To check the spelling of your message, press the ABC checkmark button in the button bar or select <bf>Edit
| Spellcheck...</bf>  Kmail uses KSpell to check spelling, which is the KDE frontend to the
the ispell spelling checker.
<p>

<sect1>Message Folders<label id="sec-Folders">
<p>
Message Folders are used to organize your email messages. By default, all message folders are stored in 
the directory <tt>Mail</tt>, which is created in your home directory. When you first 
start Kmail the inbox, outbox, sent-mail, and trash folders are created. 
These folders each have special functions:

<itemize>
<item><bf>inbox:</bf> where Kmail puts your new messages when you ask it to check your mail. 
<item><bf>outbox:</bf> where messages are put while they are waiting to be delivered. 
<item><bf>sent-mail:</bf> contains copies of all messages that you have sent. 
<item><bf>trash:</bf> contains all messages that you have deleted.
</itemize>

<p>
You may find that the standard folders are fine for your needs. Eventually, though, you will probably 
need folders to help you organize your messages. To create a new folder, select <bf>Folder | Create...</bf> 
A window will then prompt you for the name of the folder and allow you to associate or
disassociate the folder with certain accounts. If you ever need to change the settings for a folder,
select the folder you wish to modify in the Folders Pane and select <bf>Folder | Modify...</bf> 
Kmail will then prompt you for the changes you wish to make to the selected folder.
<p>
To move messages from one folder into another, select the message(s) you want to move and press the M key
or select <bf>Message | Move...</bf> A list of folders will appear.  Select the
folder from the list that you want to move the messages to and hit <bf>OK</bf>.  Messages can also be
moved by dragging a message from the Headers pane into the Folders pane.
<p>
You may find that your folders are taking up a lot of disk space after they have been used for a while 
even though they may not have very many messages in them.  To fix this problem, select the folder and 
choose <bf>Folder | Compact</bf>.
<p>
If you want to clear all of the messages out of a folder choose <bf>Folder | Empty</bf>. 
All the messages in the selected folder will be moved to the <bf>trash</bf> folder. If the
 selected folder is the <bf>trash</bf> folder, all of the messages will be permanently deleted.
<p>
Kmail does not currently support hierarchical folders.
<p>

<sect1>The Addressbook
<p>
The addressbook is a place to store your commonly used email addresses.  You can call up the addressbook
from the <bf>File</bf> menu, the addressbook button on the Main window, or the addressbook button in the
<bf>Composer</bf> window.
<p>
To add addresses to the addressbook, type an email address into the lower section of the window and hit
the <bf>Add</bf> button.  The address will then appear in the list.  To remove an address, select it from
the list and hit the <bf>Remove</bf> button. 
<p>
Addresses can also be added to the addressbook from the <bf>Mail Reader</bf> window by right-clicking on
an email address in the <bf>To:</bf> or <bf>From:</bf> fields and selecting <bf>Add to Addressbook</bf>.
<p>

<sect1>Filters
<p>
After using Kmail for a while, you may find that you have trouble sorting out the new messages in 
your inbox when they arrive. Filters allow you to automatically perform certain actions on
incoming messages and to manually perform actions on selected messages in a folder.
<p>
The actions section of the <bf>Filter Rules</bf> window lets you perform up to eight actions in one
filter. You can you the "Skip Rest" option to skip the rest of the actions in the list.  Only the transfer action and the skip rest action are supported at this time, 
but expect to see more action options available in future releases of Kmail.
<p>
Usually, filters are used on incoming messages, but they can also be applied to a message or group of
messages.  To selectively filter messages in a message folder, select the messages you want to filter and
type CONTROL-J or select <bf>Message | Apply Filters</bf>. Note that this will apply all
of your filters to that message; there is no way to apply only certain filters to a message.
<p>
If you ever need to remove a filter, select it from the <bf>Filter Rules</bf> window and press the 
<bf>Delete</bf> button.

<sect2>Filter Examples
<p>
If I am subscribed to the KDE User List, I could create a 
folder for the list (I'll call it KDE-User) and use a filter to automatically transfer new 
messages from my inbox to my KDE-User folder if they are from the KDE User List. Here is how
to create this filter:
<p>
<enum>
<item>Think of a unique way of identifying the messages you want to filter. The unique property
of my KDE User List messages is that they always contain the phrase "KDE User List" in the
<bf>To:</bf> field. If I wanted to be even more specific, I could use the email address of the
KDE User List.
<item>Select <bf>Filter...</bf> from the File menu.
<item>Press the <bf>New</bf> button to create an empty filter.
<item>Select the empty filter from the list. (It will appear as a pair of angled brackets:
&lt;&gt).
<item>The right side of the Filter window contains two sections: matching criteria and actions.
In the matching criteria area, select "To:" from the first pull-down menu, "Contains" from the
second pull-down menu, and type "KDE User List" in the text field.
<item>Skip down to the actions section. Select "Transfer" from the first pull-down menu. A new
pull-down menu containing a list of folders will appear. Select the folder that you want the
filtered messages to be transferred to if they match the criteria you selected. For this example, 
you would select "KDE-User" from the pull-down menu.
<item>Select "Skip Rest" from the next pull-down menu.
<item>To save and try out your new filter, hit the <bf>OK</bf> button.  This will also dismiss the window.
</enum>
<p>
You may find that you need to use more complicated criteria to properly filter your messages.
For example, you may only want to save the KDE User List messages that are written by your friend
Fred Johnson &lt;fj@anywhere.com&gt;. This is where the rest of the matching criteria section comes
into play:
<p>
<enum>
<item>Open up the Filter Rules window and select the filter you just created.
<item>Since you want to filter all messages that have "KDE User List" in the <bf>To:</bf> field
AND that are from Fred, select the AND option from the pull down menu between the two criteria
sections.
<item>Now, go to the bottom criteria section and select the following from the pull-down menus: 
"From:", "Contains." Now, type "fj@anywhere.com" in the text field.
<item>Select "Skip Rest" from the next pull-down menu.
</enum>
<p>
You now have a filter that transfers all KDE User List messages that are from Fred Johnson. 

<sect1>Multiple Accounts <label id="sec-MultipleAccounts">
<p>
Multiple accounts are used to check mail from more than one email address and/or mail server. Select 
<bf>File | Settings...</bf> and click on the <bf>Network</bf> tab to add or change 
your account settings. See the <ref id="sec-Customizing" name="Customizing Kmail"> section for more 
information on the settings in the <bf>Network</bf> tab.
<p>
To check mail from a particular account, use the <bf>Check Mail in...</bf> submenu to select the account
to use to check your mail. It is not currently possible to tell which account is
active, so if you have created multiple accounts, use the <bf>Check Mail
in...</bf> submenu instead of the <bf>Check Mail</bf> menu item.
<p>
 
<sect1>Pretty good privacy <label id="sec-PGP">
<p>
To use the PGP features of Kmail, you will need to have public-key encryption software such as GNU
Privacy Guard or PGP installed and have your keys created. To configure PGP, select <bf>File | Settings...</bf> 
and click on the <bf>PGP</bf> tab. Type in your PGP user identity in the space
provided and select any other options that you want before pressing the <bf>OK</bf> button to save your
settings. 
<p>
Once PGP is configured, you can use it to sign and encrypt messages. To sign an email message, toggle the
quill button on the button bar. When you send your message, you will be prompted for your PGP password.
The message will then be signed with your PGP signature and sent. 
<p>
Encrypting a message is also easy. You must have the public key(s) of the recipient(s) of your message in
order for encryption to work. Toggle the key button in the button bar to enable encryption.  The
message will be encrypted once you send it.
<p>

<sect>Customizing Kmail <label id="sec-Customizing">
<p>
Kmail's settings window gives you a number of ways to customize Kmail to your needs.
<p>
<sect1>Identity Tab
<p>
The settings in the <bf>Identity</bf> tab are fairly straightforward. The <bf>Name</bf>
and <bf>Organization</bf> fields should contain the appropriate information if you want this
information to be automatically included in the headers of any message that you send.
The <bf>Email Address</bf> and the <bf>Reply-to Address</bf> field should contain your email address. 
The <bf>Signature File</bf> field contains the location of your signature file. You can skip setting the 
signature file if you do not have one. If you do this, make sure that you also uncheck <bf>Automatically
Append Signature</bf> in the <bf>Composer</bf> tab.
<p>
<sect1>Network Tab
<p>
The <bf>Network</bf> tab contains the settings that tell Kmail how to send and receive your
email. Many of these settings can vary greatly depending on the setup of your system
and on the kind of network that your mail server is located. If you do not know what
setting to pick or what to put in a field, consult your Internet Service Provider
(ISP) or System Administrator.
<p> 
The <bf>Sending Mail</bf> section provides two options for sending mail:
sendmail and SMTP. Sendmail has a reputation of being difficult to set up, so if you
do not already have a working sendmail configuration, choose SMTP and fill in the
<bf>Server</bf> field with the name and domain of your mail server. You will probably
not need to change the <bf>Port</bf> setting.
<p>
To set up an account so you can receive mail, press the <bf>Add...</bf> button in the
<bf>Incoming Mail</bf> section. You will then be prompted for the type of account.
Most users should select <bf>POP3</bf> unless you have a setup where some other
program is already retrieving your mail into a mail file. After pressing
<bf>OK</bf> you will be presented with the <bf>Configure Account</bf> window.
First, fill in the <bf>Name</bf> field to name your account. <bf>Login</bf>,
<bf>Password</bf>, and <bf>Host</bf> should be filled in with the appropriate
information from your ISP or System Administrator. Again, you should not need to
change the <bf>Port</bf> setting. Select <bf>Delete mail from server</bf> if you
don't want to leave your mail on the server. Finally, you can set the default
box to received your new messages. <p>

<sect1>Appearance Tab
<p>
The <bf>Fonts</bf> section allows you to change the type and size of the display fonts in the <bf>Main</bf> 
and <bf>Composer</bf> windows. 
<p>
The <bf>Layout</bf> section lets you toggle the long folder list on and off.  The long folder list lists
folders all the way down the left side of the screen, which lets you see many more folders than in the
default view, but it takes away some space for viewing the text of your message. 
<sect1>Composer Tab
<p>
The <bf>Phrases</bf> section lets you define the automatically generated lines added to message replies, forwarded
messages, and quoted text. There are special %-denoted characters that will insert certain values. These
are shown at the top of the Phrases section: %D to insert the date, %S to insert the subject, %F to insert
the sender, and %% to insert a percent sign. The <bf>Indentation</bf> field contains the character that
will denote quoted text.
<p>
The <bf>Appearance</bf> section lets you control various options for your messages. <bf>Automatically Append
Signature</bf> and <bf>Automatically Sign Messages</bf> let you toggle whether to automatically include
your signature and PGP signature in all of your messages by default. <bf>Word Wrap At Column</bf> lets you
turn word wrapping on and off in the <bf>Composer window</bf> and lets you set the column at which words will be
wrapped.


<p>
The <bf>When Sending Mail</bf> section lets you customize how and when messages are sent.
<p>
The <bf>Default Sending options</bf> lets you define what happens when a message is sent. If <bf>send now</bf> is
selected, the message is sent to the mail server immediately, while if <bf>send later</bf> is selected,
the message is queued in the <bf>outbox</bf> to be sent later with the <bf>File | Send Queued</bf>
command or automatically when you check your mail, depending on the settings in the <bf>Misc</bf> tab.
<p>
The <bf>Send messages options</bf> let you select how your message will be encoded when it is sent. <bf>Allow 8
bits</bf> means that Kmail will send your message in 8 bit ASCII, which means that all special characters
such as accented letters will be sent as-is.  If <bf>MIME-compliant (Quoted-printable)</bf> is selected,
then special characters will be encoded using standard MIME encodings, which may be more portable to
other mailing systems than 8-bit ASCII.
<p>
<sect1>Misc Tab
<p>
<descrip>
<tag>Empty Trash On Exit</tag>
The trash folder is cleared of messages when you quit Kmail if this option is
selected.
<p>
<tag>Send Mail in outbox folder on Check</tag>
All messages queued in the outbox folder will be sent whenever you check your mail.
</descrip>
<p>
<sect1>PGP Tab
<p>
This tab controls the PGP features. At a minimum, you must fill in the <bf>PGP identity</bf> field so that Kmail
can properly interface with PGP or GNU Privacy Guard.
<p>

<sect>Using other Mailbox files With Kmail<label id="sec-Importing">
<p>
This section is for all of the users that need to move email messages from their previous
email client over to Kmail. Kmail stores its mail using the <bf>mbox</bf> format, one of the most widely used mailbox formats on UNIX
systems. Mbox mailboxes store messages in one file, identifying where messages start and end with the
FROM: header. For many Unix mailers, all you must do is move your mailboxes to <tt>~/Mail</tt> (or make
~Mail a symbolic link to the folder containing you mailboxes) and launch Kmail.  The mailboxes should now 
show up correctly in Kmail.
<p>
If your old mailboxes are not in mbox format, see below for instructions on importing some other common
formats.
<p>
<descrip>
<tag>Eudora Lite/Eudora Pro</tag>
<p>
Eudora uses the mbox format in its mail files. To use them with Kmail, make sure that your Eudora mailboxes have 
been compacted, then copy the .mbx files (Windows Eudora) or Eudora mailbox files (Mac Eudora) to your 
<tt>~/Mail</tt> directory. You don't need to copy the index files. 
Once you start Kmail, the mailboxes should appear in the Folders pane and the messages should be accessible in
the Headers Pane.
<p>
If messages do not appear in the Headers pane, your mailbox files may still contain Windows or Macintosh
line feed characters.  Use your favorite text editor or scripting language to change the Windows or
Macintosh line feeds to Unix line feeds.
<p>
<tag>MMDF</tag>
<p>
This format is close enough to the mailbox format that Kmail should be able to use these mailboxes if you
just copy them to your <tt>~/Mail</tt> directory. However, MMDF mailboxes have not been tested with Kmail,
so your results may vary.  If you can get this format to work with Kmail, please let us know so we
can include more specific directions in the next documentation release.
<p>
<tag>MH mailboxes</tag>
<p>
MH mailboxes are directories containing files that correspond to each message in that mailbox. 
A shell script to convert MH mailboxes to mbox mailboxes, <bf>mh2kmail</bf>, is included in the source 
releases of Kmail, but not currently in the packaged releases. (This may change in the future.) Running
this script on a MH folder will convert it to an mbox file.  We strongly suggest that you back up your MH
mail folders before you use this script.
<p>
<tag>Maildir</tag> 
<p>
Maildir mailboxes, used by the Qmail mail-transfer agent, are not supported by Kmail at this time. 
<p>
<tag>Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Notes, BeOS Mail files, cc: Mail, Pegasys, etc...</tag>
<p>
Other mail programs probably do not work with Kmail as they use specialized mail formats that Kmail cannot
understand. However, there is no harm in trying! If the mailbox file looks similar to the mbox format, try
copying the mailbox file (remember, the index file is not needed) to your <tt>~/Mail</tt> directory and
see what happens.  If you get mailboxes from your favorite mail client to work in Kmail, please tell us
how you did it so that we can include directions in a future revision of this documentation.

<sect>Questions and answers

<sect1>How do I use my (Eudora, XFmail, other random mail client) mailboxes in Kmail?
<p>
See the section <ref id="sec-Importing" name="Using other Mailbox files With Kmail">.
<p>
<sect1>How do I leave mail on the server? (from the KDE FAQ)
<p>
Open up the Settings window from the file menu. Click on the Network tab. Select your account from the account list and click the
Modify button. This dialog contains the "Delete mail from server" setting which you must not select. 
<p>
<sect1>How do I automatically insert a text footer within the mail? (from the KDE FAQ)
<p>
The text footer is called a signature file. What you need to do is open up a text editor (like kedit) and type in what you want to appear
in the footer. Save the file under a name like signature or footer. Go into Kmail and select <bf>File |
Settings...</bf> Look in the "Identity" tab
for the "signature file" field. Click on the ellipses button and select the file you just created.
Now Kmail will automatically insert that file in any message you write.
<p>
<sect1>Why does Kmail keep asking me for the location of my signature file? I
don't have/want one!
<p>
Kmail will ask you the location of your signature file if you have checked the
option <bf>Automatically Append Signature</bf> in the <bf>Composer</bf> tab of
the <bf>Settings</bf> dialog, but have not specified a signature file in the
<bf>Identity</bf> tab. You should either specify a signature file or uncheck
<bf>Automatically Append Signature</bf>.

<sect1>Why doesn't word wrap work in the
Composer window? <p>
The word wrap setting is probably turned off. Word wrap can be toggled on and off in the 
<bf>Composer</bf> tab of the <bf>Settings</bf> dialog box.
