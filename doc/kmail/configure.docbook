<title>Configure &kmail;</title>

<para>&kmail;'s configuration window enables you to configure &kmail;
in many ways. You can reach it via
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
&kmail;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>

<para>It is divided into six
pages, each of them represented by one of the
icons in the list on the left hand side of the dialog. This chapter
will describe each page in detail.</para>

<sect1 id="configure-identity">
<title><guilabel>Identities</guilabel> Page</title>

<para>You can find a quick introduction to the
<guilabel>Identities</guilabel> page in the <link
linkend="getting-started">Getting Started</link> section.</para>

<para>This page allows you to create one or more
<emphasis>Identities</emphasis>, &ie; combinations of name, email
address and other settings. For example, you can create one identity
for business communication and one for
personal communication. If you have more than one email
address, you can create one identity per address. You will then be
able to select an identity on a per-message basis.</para>

<para>The page consists of a list of identities and buttons to manage
them. The identities list will always show at
least one identity, which is then the <guilabel>Default</guilabel> 
identity.</para>

<para>To add a new identity to the identity list, click on the
<guibutton>New...</guibutton> button. 
The <link linkend="configure-identity-newidentitydialog">New identity</link> dialog
will show up.</para>

<sect2 id="configure-identity-newidentitydialog">
<title>The <guilabel>New Identity</guilabel> Dialog</title>

<para>You can enter the name of the new identity into the
<guilabel>New Identity</guilabel> edit field. This will be the name
shown in the identity list.</para>

<para>You can choose how the new identity should be initialized by
checking one of the three radio buttons in the middle of the
dialog:</para>

anyway.</para>
<note><para>This field is only useful if you want replies to your mail
to go somewhere else than your regular email address, &eg; if you are
using this identity to send messages from an email address that cannot
receive messages. Note that this field will possibly be
deprecated by newer versions of the Internet email standard. Furthermore,
some mailing lists overwrite this header field with their post address to
make sure that replies go to the list instead of individuals. So the
usefulness of this field is very limited and it should only be used in
rare cases.</para></note>

<para>Select here the <application>OpenPGP</application> key
key that should be used to (digitally) sign messages when this

<sect2 id="configure-identity-signature">
<title><guilabel>Signature</guilabel></title>

<para>This tab allows you to specify a signature (sometimes called
<quote>footer</quote> or <quote>disclaimer</quote>)
to be appended to each message sent using this identity.</para>

<note><para>This type of signature has nothing to do with the
(digital) signatures for which you can select the to-be-used key on
the <link linkend="configure-identity-advanced">Advanced
tab</link>. It is just bad wording to call this a signature, but since
the term is already used everywhere else, we keep this notation. Just
keep in mind that these signatures and digital signatures are two
completely different things.</para></note>

<para>Check the <guilabel>Enable signature</guilabel> option if you
want to be able to append the signature when using this identity. To
<emphasis>automatically</emphasis> append it to every new message
you also have to select <guilabel>Automatically append
signature</guilabel> in the <guilabel>Composer</guilabel> configuration page.</para>

<para>&kmail; can obtain the signature text from various sources. The
traditional way on Unix is to read the text from a file called
<filename>.signature</filename> in your home directory. This file can
be shared between several programs, so you get the same
signature in each mail program you use.</para>

<para>To read the text from a text file you select
<guilabel>Obtain signature text from file</guilabel>. Enter the
filename in the <guilabel>Specify file</guilabel> edit field or hit
the button to the right of it to browse your filesystem. If you want
to edit the file, hit the <guilabel>Edit File</guilabel>
button.</para>

<para>&kmail; can also read the signature text from the output of a
command. Thus, you can use programs such as
<command>fortune</command> to create a new signature text for
every message. Everything the program prints onto
<acronym>stdout</acronym> is catched and used as the signature
text.</para>

<para>To read the text from the output of a command you select
<guilabel>Obtain signature text from Output of
Command</guilabel>. Enter the command (preferably with full path) in
the <guilabel>Specify command</guilabel> edit field or hit the button
to the right of it to browse your filesystem.</para>

<para>As a third option, you can enter the signature text directly in
&kmail;'s configuration dialog. To do this, select <guilabel>Obtain
signature text from input field below</guilabel> and enter the text
into the appearing text box.</para>

<note><para>On the Internet, signatures are by convention separated
from the body of the message by a line containing only the three
character <quote>-- </quote> (dash, dash, space). &kmail; will
automatically prepend the signature text with this line if it is not
already present in the signature text.</para>
<para>If you do not wish the separator to be prepended
automatically by &kmail;, simply add it to the signature 
text yourself.</para>
</note>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="configure-network">
<title><guilabel>Network</guilabel> Page</title>

<para>You can find a quick introduction to the
<guilabel>Network</guilabel> page in the <link
linkend="setting-up-your-account">Setting up your Account</link>
section.</para>

<para>This page allows you to create one or more (incoming and
outgoing) <emphasis>accounts</emphasis>, &ie; combinations of mail
servers, login information and other settings. Typically, you will
create one outgoing (used for sending messages) and one incoming (used to
retrieve messages) account. You can create as many accounts as you want, though,
and assign each one to different <link
linkend="configure-identity">identities</link> or decide on a per-message
basis.</para>

<sect2 id="configure-network-sending">
<title><guilabel>Sending</guilabel></title>

<para>The <guilabel>Sending</guilabel> tab allows you to define new
outgoing mail servers and set some common options.</para>

<para>For basic information, see <link
linkend="sending-mail">Setting up your Account: Sending</link>.</para>

<para>When you click <guibutton>Add...</guibutton> or <guibutton>Modify...</guibutton>
the <guilabel>Add transport</guilabel> resp. <guilabel>Modify
transport</guilabel> dialog will open. For sending via <command>sendmail</command> you
can specify a name and the location of the <command>sendmail</command> program.
For <acronym>SMTP</acronym> you can specify <guilabel>Name</guilabel>,
<guilabel>Host</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Port</guilabel> of the server.
<guilabel>Server requires authentication</guilabel> will enable the
<guilabel>Login</guilabel> and <guilabel>Password</guilabel> fields and
the <guilabel>Authentication method</guilabel> buttons on the
<guilabel>Security</guilabel> tab. If you are not sure about the
security settings you can make &kmail; test for the best settings
by using <guibutton>Check What the Server Supports</guibutton>.</para>

<para><guilabel>Confirm before send</guilabel> will pop up a
confirmation box every time you send a message.</para>

<para><guilabel>Send messages in outbox folder on check</guilabel> will send
all messages from the outbox when you check for new messages.</para>

<para><guilabel>Default send method</guilabel> lets you define what
happens when a message is sent. If <guilabel>Send now</guilabel> is
selected, the message is sent to the mail server immediately, while if
<guilabel>Send later</guilabel> is selected, the message is queued in
the outbox to be sent later with the
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Send
Queued Messages</guimenuitem></menuchoice> command or automatically when you
check your mail, depending on the setting of 
<guilabel>Send messages in outbox folder on check</guilabel> above.</para>

<para><guilabel>Message property</guilabel> lets you select how your
message will be encoded when it is sent. <guilabel>Allow
8-bit</guilabel> means that &kmail; will send your message in 8 bit
<acronym>ASCII</acronym>, which means that all special characters such
as accented letters will be sent as-is. If <guilabel>MIME Compliant
(Quoted Printable)</guilabel> is selected, special characters will be
encoded using standard &MIME; encodings, which may be more portable to
other mailing systems than 8-bit <acronym>ASCII</acronym>. You normally
do not need to change the default.<!-- TODO: advise what is better --></para>

<para><guilabel>Default domain</guilabel> lets you specify which domain name
should be used to complete email addresses that only consist of the recipient's user
name. For example when you set the default domain to <replaceable>kde.org</replaceable>
then messages you send to <replaceable>johndoe</replaceable> will be sent to 
<replaceable>johndoe@kde.org</replaceable>.</para>

<sect2 id="configure-network-receiving">
<title><guilabel>Receiving</guilabel></title>

<para>For basic information, see <link
linkend="receiving-mail">Setting up your Account: Receiving</link>.</para>

<para>With <guilabel>New Mail Notification</guilabel> you can set
how &kmail; will notify you if new messages have arrived. Of course
this only makes sense if <guilabel>Enable interval mail checking</guilabel>
is activated for at least one account: <guilabel>Beep</guilabel> will
play a short beep sound, while more advanced notification options
are available via the <guibutton>Other Actions</guibutton> button.</para>

<sect1 id="configure-appearance">
<title>Appearance Page</title>

<sect2 id="configure-appearance-fonts">
<title>Fonts</title>

<para>This section allows you to change the type, size and character set of the
display fonts. <guilabel>Message Body</guilabel> sets the font for
the reader pane, <guilabel>Composer</guilabel> sets the font for
writing messages in the composer window.<!-- fixme in kmail: better wording? -->
There is a separate entry for <guilabel>Message List - Date Field</guilabel>
so you can choose a monospaced font for the date field for better readability.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="configure-appearance-colors">
<title>Colors</title>

<para>This section allows you to change the color of the text.
<guilabel>Recycle colors on deep quoting</guilabel> means that even text that is
quoted more than three times will appear in color. Note that the
<guilabel>Quoted text</guilabel> colors only work in the message reader, not in 
the composer.<!-- TODO --></para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="configure-appearance-layout">
<title>Layout</title>

<para><guilabel>Show HTML status bar</guilabel> activates a bar at the left side of the reader
pane that tells you if a message is HTML or not. This is important because
HTML messages might imitate the look of a signed and encrypted message, so
you should be aware of the fact that you are reading a HTML message. The HTML
status bar itself cannot be influenced by the HTML code of the message.</para>

<para>The <guilabel>Window Layout</guilabel> section lets choose between
several layouts of the main window that differ with regard to the size
of the folder list and to the position of the MIME tree. Let the mouse pointer 
rest over the icons and you will see a tooltip that explains
the differences between the layouts.</para>

<para>The <guilabel>Show MIME Tree</guilabel> option lets you choose when
the MIME tree will be shown: the MIME tree is a part of the main window that
lets you access all attachments of a message. <guilabel>Never</guilabel> will
disable the MIME tree (note that you can still access attachments as icons),
<guilabel>Always</guilabel> will show a MIME tree even if the message does not
have an attachment. <guilabel>Smart</guilabel> will display the MIME tree
only if it makes sense, &ie; if the current message has at least one attachment.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="configure-appearance-headers">
<title>Headers</title>

<para>With <guilabel>Display message sizes</guilabel> selected there will be another 
column in the header pane that shows the messages' size.</para>

<para><guilabel>Show crypto icons</guilabel> will add more status information
to the <guilabel>Subject</guilabel> columns in the header pane: every message
that has been signed will have a small <guiicon>Signed</guiicon> icon in front
of the subject, every message that has been encrypted will have a small
<guiicon>Encrypted</guiicon> icon in front of the subject. Note that you have
to select a message once before these icons will appear, until then only
question marks will be displayed.</para>

<para><guilabel>Thread list of message headers</guilabel> will put all the messages 
in the header pane in a kind of tree list, so that the replies to a message are 
directly below that message.</para>

<para>With <guilabel>Message header threading options</guilabel> you can select
whether threads should appear expanded (<guilabel>open</guilabel>) by
default or whether they should be collapsed (<guilabel>closed</guilabel>).
You can of course still open/close threads using the  <guilabel>+</guilabel>/<guilabel>-</guilabel>
buttons.</para> 

<para>With <guilabel>Date Display</guilabel> you can choose between several
date formats. The <guilabel>Localized Format</guilabel> is the one you can
specify under <guilabel>Country &amp; Language</guilabel> in &kcontrol;.
For the <guilabel>Custom</guilabel> format you can get
a description of the possible values by pressing
<keycombo action="simul">&Shift;<keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>
and then clicking on <guilabel>Custom</guilabel> option.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="configure-appearance-profiles">
<title>Profiles</title>

<para>This section offers several default settings for &kmail;'s layout. You can
use these as starting points for your own configuration.</para>

<warning><para>Note that choosing
one of the offered profiles will override your current layout settings.</para></warning>

<para><guilabel>Automatically append signature</guilabel> lets you toggle
whether to automatically include your signature as defined in the 
<link linkend="setting-your-identity">identity page</link>.</para>

<para><guilabel>Use smart quoting</guilabel> will break long lines but will try
to keep the correct quoting (&eg; the <quote>&gt; </quote> will always be at the
start of the line).</para>

<para><guilabel>Word wrap at column</guilabel> lets you turn word wrapping on
and off in the composer window and lets you set the column
at which words will be wrapped (you probably should not need to change
the default value, which is <userinput>78</userinput>).</para>

<para>If you do not like the Composer you can use a
different editor. Note that the composer window will still open and
the external editor will open as soon as you type just one character in the body
of the message. If you're done, save the text and exit the editor. The text will
now appear in the composer window, where you can send
it. Note that your editor may not return immediately, you have to
use &eg; <userinput>gvim -f %f</userinput> for <application>gvim</application>.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="configure-composer-phrases">
<title>Phrases</title>

<para>The <guilabel>Phrases</guilabel> tab lets you define the automatically
generated lines that are added to message replies, forwarded messages, and the
character that is added in front of quoted text. 
There are special &percnt;-denoted characters that will insert certain
values, which are also displayed at the top of the <guilabel>Phrases</guilabel> section.
You can add reply phrases in languages other than
your default &kde; language using the <guilabel>Language</guilabel> button.
This will only work for languages whose i18n package you have installed.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="configure-composer-subject">
<title>Subject</title>

<para>This section contains a list of prefixes for <quote>Reply</quote> and
<quote>Forward</quote>. If you receive messages that use prefixes different
to the standard ones, you can add them here so &kmail; will recognize 
them. This way &kmail; can ignore them for sorting messages and
when setting the subject of a reply, and optionally replace them 
with <quote>Re:</quote>.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="configure-composer-charset">
<title>Charset</title>

<para>Here you can manage the default charsets used for your own messages. 
Every message you send will be checked if it is written in one of the listed
charsets, starting at the top of the list. If it is, this charset will be used.
If it is not, a dialog will show up and tell you that you manually have to choose
a charset using 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Options</guimenu><guisubmenu>Set Encoding</guisubmenu></menuchoice>.
</para>

<para>If you select <guilabel>Keep original charset when replying
or forwarding</guilabel>, the original message's charset
will be kept, unless there are now characters that cannot be
represented using that charset.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="configure-composer-headers">
<title>Headers</title>

<para>Check the <guilabel>Use custom message-id suffix</guilabel>
checkbox if you want &kmail; to generate Message-Id's with a custom
suffix. Enter the desired suffix in the <guilabel>Custom message-id
suffix</guilabel> field. Please make sure that the suffix that you
specify is world-wide unique. The best thing is to use the name of a
domain which you are the owner of. If you do not check <guilabel>Use
custom Message-Id suffix</guilabel> then &kmail; will automatically
generate the complete Message-Id. If you do not know what this is all
about do not check this option.</para>

<para>The <guilabel>Define custom mime header fields</guilabel> list
sets the headers that &kmail; will use for its outgoing messages. You
can both invent new fields and overwrite existing ones. This feature
