<title>Using &kmail;</title>

<sect1 id="the-mail-reader-window">
<title>The Main Window</title>

<para>The main window is the window that appears
when &kmail; is started. It is by default divided into three panes:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Folder list (on the left)</term>
<listitem>
<para>This pane contains the list of your message folders (other email programs
may call them mailboxes). To select a folder, simply click on
it. The messages contained in the folder will now appear in the Headers
pane. The folder list can be displayed in both a short view, which takes up only
a small portion of the left side of the screen, and a long view, which takes up the
entire left side of the screen but is able to show more mailboxes. You can toggle
between these two views under <guilabel>Appearance</guilabel>/<guilabel>Layout</guilabel>
in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
&kmail;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> dialog. Also see the <link
linkend="folders">Folders Section</link> for more information about how to use
folders.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Message list (in the upper right by default)</term>
<listitem>
<para>This pane lists header information (message Status Flags, Sender, Subject,
Date, and other optional columns like Size, Attachment Flag, Important Flag, etc.)
for the messages in the currently selected folder. Clicking on a header
will select that message and display it in the Message pane; you can also select
more than one message by holding down the &Ctrl; key when clicking on messages.
You may sort the messages by clicking on the column that you wish to
sort; if you click on the same column more than once, sort order will toggle
between ascending/descending and some alternative sorting criteria will become
available (like sorting by Status when you click on the header of the Subject column).
Clicking the <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> mousebutton on the list header shows a popup menu,
which allows to show or hide several columns in the list.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Message preview pane (in the lower right by default)</term>
<listitem>
<para>This pane displays the currently selected message. Attachments appear
at the bottom of the message, either as icons or embedded in the message,
depending on <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Attachments</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. For complex messages
the structure of the message is shown in the message structure viewer below
the preview pane. The placement of the preview pane as well as the placement
of the structure viewer can be changed under <guilabel>Appearance</guilabel>/<guilabel>Layout</guilabel>
in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
&kmail;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> dialog. Moreover, you can disable the
preview pane and you can choose when the message structure viewer should be
shown.
You can scroll through the message page-by-page
using the <keycap>Page Up</keycap> and <keycap>Page down</keycap> keys, or
line-by-line using the <keycap>up arrow</keycap> and <keycap>down arrow</keycap>
keys; you can also use <link linkend="keyboard-shortcuts">key shortcuts</link> to skip through
your messages without having to use the mouse.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Font type and font size</term>
<listitem>
<para>Font type and font size buttons in main toolbar in the message reader window ( window that appears when an message is double clicked or enter is pressed on the message ) will change the font type or font size of the whole text of the email message in concern. This property is transient ( per email message ) and will be lost when the reader window is closed.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Delete Attachment</term>
<listitem>
<para>Right click on the attachment either in the message itself or in the message structure window, choose "Delete Attachment" to delete the attachement. Please note that deleting an attachment can invalidate any digital signature in the message.</para>

<sect1 id="the-composer-window">
<title>The Composer Window</title>

<para>The composer window is used to write new messages;
it can be invoked via <menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>New Message...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
menu or from the <guiicon>New Message</guiicon> icon on the main
window.</para>

<sect2 id="composing-a-message">
<title>Composing a Message</title>

<para>To write your message, fill in the appropriate fields in the
composer window. Use the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu
to select which header fields are displayed. The <guimenuitem>Identity</guimenuitem>
field offers a <guibutton>Sticky</guibutton> option; if it is checked,
the current identity will become the default identity when you open
a new composer next time.</para>

<para>There are a variety of shortcuts to help
you with writing your messages. The <guibutton>...</guibutton> buttons next to
the <guilabel>To:</guilabel>, <guilabel>CC:</guilabel>, and
<guilabel>BCC:</guilabel> fields will call up the address book so that you can
select addresses from there.</para>

<para>When you start typing an address in the
<guilabel>To:</guilabel>/<guilabel>CC:</guilabel>/<guilabel>BCC:</guilabel>
fields, a popup will appear that offers matching addresses that have been used recently
and matching addresses from your address book. If you use multiple addressbooks, you can
use the TAB key to select the first entry of the next addressbook in the list.
If you do not like the automatic popup you can disable it by clicking with the &RMB; on the field and choosing
a different completion mode.</para>

<para>Whenever you want to add more than one
recipient in one of the fields, use a comma to separate each address
from the next one.
<!-- fixme: there's now a setting for this: -->
You may need to specify fully qualified addresses
(&ie; <userinput>user@example.com</userinput>) even for local
users, depending on your system configuration.</para>

<para>When you are finished with your
message, click the <guiicon>Send Now</guiicon> icon (the envelope) to send
the message now, or click the <guiicon>Send Later</guiicon> icon to put
the message in the outbox. If your message is not finished yet, select

<sect2 id="html-mails">
<title>Creating HTML Messages</title>

<para>Note that HTML messages are often regarded as an annoyance; therefore,
you should avoid sending HTML messages if possible. Particularly, you should never
send HTML messages to a mailing list unless HTML messages are explicitly
allowed.</para>

<para>In order to be able to create HTML messages you first have to enable
the markup tools. To do this enable <guimenuitem>Formatting (HTML)</guimenuitem> in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Options</guimenu></menuchoice> menu.
A toolbar with several tools to
format the message will appear. Via the drop down box you can select between
standard text and six different types of lists (three bulleted lists with
different symbols and three numbered lists with different numbering).
Moreover, you can select the font family, the font size, the font style (bold,
italic, underlined) and the text color. Last but not least, you can select
the alignment of the text (left aligned, centered, right aligned).</para>

<para>Creating tables and embedding images is currently not possible.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="attachments">
<title>Adding Attachments</title>

<para>You can attach files to your message by using one of the methods
below:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Click the <guiicon>Attach File</guiicon> (paper clip) icon and select the file you wish
to attach;</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Drag a file from the desktop or another folder into the
composer window;</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Drag a message from &kmail;'s message list into the composer
window -- that message will then be attached;</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Select one of the options in the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Attach</guimenu></menuchoice> menu.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Once a file is attached to your message, it appears in the attachments
pane at the bottom of the composer window. You can use the
&RMB; on each attachment to <guimenuitem>View</guimenuitem>,
<guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>Remove</guimenuitem>
the attachment.</para>

<para>Use the <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> item to
open the <guilabel>Message Part Properties</guilabel> dialog.
The first field contains the attachment's &MIME; type. Just like the <guilabel>Name</guilabel>
field, it should be automatically filled with an appropriate value. Sometimes the
&MIME; type value may be wrong. You can then type in any &MIME; type or
choose from the list of common &MIME; types. You can also select an encoding
method for your file from the list of encoding options (normally, the default
value works fine). Check the <guilabel>Suggest automatic display</guilabel> option
if you want to suggest to the recipient the automatic (inline) display of this attachment. Whether this works or not depends on the recipient's email client
and on his settings.</para>

<para>You can also attach public keys to the message by using the appropriate options in the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Attach</guimenu></menuchoice> menu. <application>PGP</application>
key attachments are handled like file attachments.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="checking-the-spelling-of-your-message">
<title>Checking the Spelling of your Message</title>

<para>&kmail; will automatically check the spelling of your message (in
HTML mode this currently does not work)
and display unknown words using red color. If there are too many
unknown words &kmail; will disable its checking. To select the language
used for checking, select <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Dictionary</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. You can disable
automatic spellchecking in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Options</guimenu></menuchoice> menu.</para>

<para>To check the spelling of your message using a dialog, select
<menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Spelling...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. &kmail; uses
<ulink url="/kspell/">&kspell;</ulink> to
check spelling, which is the &kde; frontend to the
<application>ispell</application> or <application>aspell</application> spelling
checker. Note that you may first need to configure the spellchecker using
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Spellchecker...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>

<sect1 id="folders">
<title>Message Folders</title>

<para>Message Folders are used to organize your email messages. By default,
if you have no existing message folders, messages are stored in the folder
<filename
class="directory">$<envar>KDEHOME</envar>/share/apps/kmail/</filename>.  If
you have existing message folders in <filename
class="directory">~/Mail</filename>, these will be used instead.  When you
first start &kmail; the <guilabel>inbox</guilabel>,
<guilabel>outbox</guilabel>, <guilabel>sent-mail</guilabel>,
<guilabel>trash</guilabel> and <guilabel>drafts</guilabel> folders are
created.  These folders each have special functions:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>inbox:</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>Where &kmail; by default puts your new messages when you ask it to check your

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>outbox:</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>Where messages are put while they are waiting to be delivered. Note that

</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>You may find that the standard folders are fine for your
needs; eventually, though, you will probably need folders to help you organize
your messages. To create a new folder, select
<menuchoice><guimenu>Folder</guimenu><guimenuitem>New Folder...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>:
the <link linkend="folders-properties-window">folder properties</link> dialog

from the list that you want to move the messages to.  Messages can also be moved
by dragging them from the Message list to a folder in the Folder list.</para>

<para>If you want to clear all of the messages out of a folder choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>Folder</guimenu><guimenuitem>Move All Messages to
Trash</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. You can use
<menuchoice><guimenu>Folder</guimenu><guimenuitem>Delete Folder</guimenuitem></menuchoice>

<para>Check <guilabel>Ignore new mail in this folder</guilabel> if you do not
want to be informed about new mail that arrives in this folder. This is for
example useful for the folder where you move all detected spam messages to.</para>

<para>Check <guilabel>Keep replies in this folder</guilabel> if you want
replies to messages in this folder to be filed also into this folder rather
than into a special sent-mail folder.</para>

<para>For calendar folders you can select who should get reminders for the contained

<title>Mailing List</title>

<para>If you are going to use the folder for a mailing list then you should
check <guilabel>Folder holds a mailing list</guilabel> to associate this folder
with the mailing list. Next you should
click on <guilabel>Detect Automatically</guilabel>. &kmail; will then try
to guess some information about the mailing list from the currently selected

<sect2 id="folders-format">
<title>Folder Format</title>

<para>A message folder can be either in <guilabel>mbox</guilabel> or in <guilabel>maildir</guilabel>
format. <guilabel>mbox</guilabel> saves all messages of a folder to one file,
whereas <guilabel>maildir</guilabel> saves each message to its own file.
<guilabel>maildir</guilabel>, which is the default format, can be considered more
robust, but it can be slower on some file systems. If you are unsure,
choose <guilabel>maildir</guilabel>.</para>

<para>Note that there is currently no feature in &kmail; that allows you to convert
between both formats automatically, but you can just move all messages from an old
<guilabel>mbox</guilabel> folder to a new <guilabel>maildir</guilabel> folder or
vice-versa.</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="filters">
<title>Message Filters</title>
<anchor id="filters-id"/>

<para>After using &kmail; for a while, you may find that you have trouble
sorting out the new messages in your inbox when they arrive. Filters allow you
to automatically perform certain actions on incoming messages and to manually
perform actions on selected messages in a folder.</para>

<para>Please note that the filters described in this section are
applied <emphasis>after</emphasis> the messages have been downloaded
from your account -- if you want to filter messages on the server, see
<link linkend="popfilters">Download Filters</link>.</para>

<para>Filters consist of: filter criteria, whose rules are used as
criteria to determine whether this filter should be applied to a given
message; and a list of filter actions, which describe what is to be
done with, or to, the message if the search pattern matches. Read more
about filter criteria and filter actions in the following
subsections.</para>

<note><para>Filters are considered one after the other,
starting with the first filter in the list. The first one whose
pattern matches the given message gets executed; you can request that
the remaining filters also be applied, but the default is to stop
processing at the first matching filter. </para></note>

<para>Usually, filters are used on incoming messages, but they can
also be applied to sent messages or to an arbitrary message or group
of messages. To selectively filter messages, select the messages you
want to filter in the message list and either type <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>J</keycap> </keycombo> or select
<menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Apply
Filters</guimenuitem></menuchoice>: this will apply all filters that
have been marked for manual filtering in the <link
linkend="filter-dialog">filter dialog</link> to those messages.</para>

<sect2 id="filter-quick">
<title>Fast Filter Creation</title>

<para>There are two methods for creating a filter; the quick method is
to use <menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu><guimenuitem>Create
Filter</guimenuitem></menuchoice>: this will call the filter dialog
and present you with a new filter which has the first rule of the
search pattern and the first action (as <guilabel>Move into Folder</guilabel>)
preset. In most cases, all you have to do is select the folder where the message
should be moved to; but you can, of course, edit the filter as you
like.</para>

<para>When creating a filter on mailing list messages this method
will try really hard to find a criterion that
uniquely identifies messages from that list; If it succeeds, the guessed
name of the list is presented in the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu><guisubmenu>Create
Filter</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Filter on
Mailing-List...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu entry.</para>

<para>The second method is to manually construct a filter from scratch
by calling the filter dialog through
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
Filters...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. The filter dialog is described in
detail in the following subsection.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="filter-dialog">
<title>The Filter Dialog</title>
<anchor id="filter-dialog-id"/>

<para>This dialog allows you to manage and edit your list of
filters.</para>

<para>You can reach it either via
<menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu><guisubmenu>Create
Filter</guisubmenu></menuchoice> or
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
Filters...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>

<para>The dialog is divided into four main sections:</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Available Filters</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>This group contains the list of filters and some action
buttons to modify the filters, namely: to create new filters; to move them up or
down the list; to delete them; or to rename them. If you select
a filter from the list, its properties are shown in the right-hand half
of the dialog.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Filter Criteria</guilabel></term> <listitem><para>In
this group you can edit the pattern that messages must match for the
filter to be applied to them. You can select here whether all of the
defined rules must match or whether it suffices that any one of them
matches. See <link linkend="filter-criteria">Search Patterns</link>
below for a detailed description of each search rule type.</para>

<para> You can click on <guibutton>More</guibutton> to get an
additional (initially empty) rule if you want to define more-complex
patterns and on <guibutton>Fewer</guibutton> to remove the last
rule. <guibutton>Clear</guibutton> clears the pattern, &ie; it removes
all but two rules from screen and resets those two.</para>
<para>Invalid or empty rules are not evaluated.</para>

<term><guilabel>Filter Actions</guilabel></term> <listitem><para>In
this group you can edit the list of actions that are applied to all
messages that match the defined filter criteria. See <link
linkend="filter-action">Filter Actions</link> below for a detailed
description of each action type.</para>

<para> You can click on <guibutton>More</guibutton> to get a new,
empty action (if you want to define more than one action) and on
<guibutton>Fewer</guibutton> to remove the last
action. <guibutton>Clear</guibutton> clears the list, &ie; it
removes all but one action and resets that one.</para>
<para>Invalid or empty actions are not executed.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Advanced Options</guilabel></term>

<listitem>

<para>In this group you can define a few advanced options for filters
that allow you to refine your filtering.</para>

<para>Using the first row of check boxes, you can toggle when the
filter is applied: the <guilabel>to incoming messages</guilabel>
option means that the filter is applied to messages when you receive
them (&ie; on <guiicon>Check Mail</guiicon>); the <guilabel>to sent
messages</guilabel> options means that the filter is applied to
messages when you send them and the <guilabel>on manual
filtering</guilabel> option controls whether to apply this filter when
filtering is specifically selected (&ie; via
<menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Apply
Filters</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.)</para>

<para>The <guilabel>If this filter matches, stop processing here</guilabel>
check box in the second row controls whether or not the filters after
the current filter will be applied, if the current filter matches.</para>

<para>If the <guilabel>Add this filter to the Apply Filter menu</guilabel>
check box in the third row is selected, this filter will be inserted
in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Apply
Filter</guimenuitem></menuchoice> submenu. You can then apply this
filter to a message. Another way of applying filters is to use
<menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Apply
Filters</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu option, which applies <emphasis>all</emphasis>
the filters - one after another until they are all used or one of the
filters that matches has the <guilabel>If the filters matches, stop
processing here</guilabel>.</para>

</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<note><para>Filters are automatically named unless you explicitly
rename them using the <guibutton>Rename...</guibutton> button.
The dialog assumes that it should continue auto-naming the filter
as long as the filter name starts with <quote>&lt;</quote>.
</para></note>

<note>
<para>If you apply filter changes, via
<guibutton>OK</guibutton> or <guibutton>Apply</guibutton>, only valid
filters are actually copied to the internal filter manager.</para>

<para>Similarly, empty rules and actions are removed from the pattern
and action list respectively, before the filter is saved.</para>
</note>

<sect2 id="filter-criteria">
<title>Search Patterns</title>

<para>The most common use of filters is to filter on the sender of
messages; this can be done by choosing <guilabel>From</guilabel>. A

<title>Filter Examples</title>

<para>If I am subscribed to the (general) &kde; List, I could create a
folder for the list (I will call it
<replaceable>KDE-General</replaceable>) and use a filter to
automatically transfer new messages from my inbox to my
<replaceable>KDE-General</replaceable> folder if they are from the
&kde; List. Here is how to create this filter:</para>

<procedure>
<title>Filtering a mailing list</title>
<step>
<para>Try if <menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu><guisubmenu>Create
filter</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Filter on
Mailing-List...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> can identify the mailing
list (the name of the list should then appear in the menu item); in
this case, this works and I am presented a filter that has
<quote>List-Id<guilabel>contains</guilabel>
&lt;kde.kde.org&gt;</quote> preset. You select the
desired destination folder from the folder pull-down menu in the
<guilabel>Filter Action</guilabel> group and that is it.</para>

<para>If that does not work, think of a unique way of identifying the
messages you want to filter. The (almost) unique property of my &kde;
List messages is that they always contain
<quote>kde@kde.org</quote> in the
<guilabel>To:</guilabel> or <guilabel>CC:</guilabel> field. It is only
almost unique, because this fails for cross-posted messages.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Select <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
Filters...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Press the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button to create an empty
filter. It will appear as <guilabel>&lt;unknown&gt;</guilabel>.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>In the <guilabel> Filter Criteria</guilabel> area, select
<guilabel>&lt;recipients&gt;</guilabel> from the first drop-down box,
<guilabel>contains</guilabel> from the second drop-down box, and type
<userinput>kde@kde.org</userinput> in the text
field.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Skip down to the <guilabel>Filter Actions</guilabel> section. Select <guilabel>file into
folder</guilabel> from the first drop-down box. A new drop-down box
containing a list of folders will appear. Select the folder that you
want the filtered messages to be transferred to. For this example, you would select
<guilabel>KDE-General</guilabel> from the drop-down box.</para>
</step>
</procedure>

<para>You may find that you need to use more powerful criteria to
properly filter your messages; for example, you may only want to
filter the &kde; List messages that are written by your friend <replaceable>Fred
Johnson &lt;fj@anywhere.com&gt;</replaceable>. This is where the rest of the
matching criteria section comes into play:</para>

<procedure>
<title>Extending the filter</title>
<step>
<para>Open up the <guilabel>Configure Filters...</guilabel> window and select
the filter you just created.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Since you want to filter all messages that have
<replaceable>kde@kde.org</replaceable> in the
<guilabel>To:</guilabel> or <guilabel>CC:</guilabel> field
<emphasis>and</emphasis> that are from Fred, check the
<guibutton>Match all of the following</guibutton> radio
button.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Now, go to the second search rule and select the following from
the pull-down menus: <guilabel>From</guilabel>,
<guilabel>contains</guilabel>. Now, type
<userinput>fj@anywhere.com</userinput> in the text field.</para>
</step>
</procedure>

<para>You now have a filter that transfers all &kde; List messages
that are from <userinput>fj@anywhere.com</userinput>.</para>

<sect2 id="filter-optimization">
<title>Filter Optimization</title>

<para>It is important to know that, for example, the order of the
filters has an  impact on the speed of the filter process. Here are
some ideas which can help you to improve the filtering:
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Stop filter processing as early as possible:</term>
<listitem>
<para>If you know that a filter finally processes a certain class of
messages, please make sure to check the option <guilabel>If this filter
matches, stop processing here</guilabel> for the filter.
This will avoid the evaluation of the filter rules of all subsequent
filters. (See the advanced options in the <link linkend="filter-dialog-id">
Filter Dialog</link>).</para>
<para>An example is filtering messages from mailing lists via List-Id
header into separate folders. Having found out that a message came from
list A means that you can avoid checking the next filter for messages
from list B.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Consider the costs of the evaluation of filter rules:</term>
<listitem>
<para>The time required to evaluate a filter rule depends on the way
the rule is constructed. In particular, scanning for a
substring using the <guilabel>contains</guilabel> operation is faster
than a pattern matching using the <guilabel>matches regular
expr.</guilabel> operation.
</para>
<para>Another dependency is on the amount of data which is used for the
evaluation of a filter rule. If the rule is based on a message header,
its evaluation should normally be much faster than the evaluation of
a rule based on the complete message.
</para>
<para>You should try to keep the filter rules as simple as possible.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>


<varlistentry>
<term>Check the order of your filters:</term>
<listitem>
<para>All the different filter actions have a different complexity.
The most expensive filter actions are <guilabel>pipe through</guilabel>
and <guilabel>execute command</guilabel>, because both need external
programs to be run. Placing filters containing these filter actions
behind other filters that can reduce the number of times these complex
actions are required is useful, if the filter logic does allow
this.</para>
<para>An example is filtering messages from a mailing list and detecting
spam messages. For the spam detection you will usually use an external
tool via a <guilabel>pipe through</guilabel> action. Filtering the messages
for the mailing list is done via the List-Id header. If you do not want to
check the messages from the mailing list for spam too, it is better to
use the filter for the mailing list messages before the filter for the
spam detection. This way you avoid the expensive and slow spam check for all
messages which were identified as mailing list messages.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="filter-logging">
<title>Filter Log</title>
<para>If you want to verify that your filters work as intended, you can
open a viewer for the filter log via <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Filter Log Viewer...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
</para>
<para>In the viewer, there you can configure  the logging of the filter
processing. You can control the detail level of the log, clear the log
or save the log into a file. The log can provide valuable information if
you need to debug your filtering process.

</sect1>

<!-- dnaber update 2004-02-22 -->
<sect1 id="popfilters">
<title>Download Filters</title>

<para>Download Filters can be used to filter mail from a POP server,
<emphasis>before</emphasis> they are completely downloaded; you can use them
to prevent &kmail; from downloading huge messages and save time this
way.</para>

<para>In the configuration dialog of the POP account you can enable
download filtering by checking the <guilabel>Filter messages if
they are greater than</guilabel> box; once you have done that, you can specify a size
which is used as a threshold: messages exceeding this size will be
checked against the filter rules you defined -- if no filter rule
matches, they will be shown in a confirmation dialog and you can
decide what to do with them. The default size for filtering is 50,000
Bytes; this is a good value as the overhead is kept to a minimum --
every message that is looked at by the filter causes additional
traffic because the header of the message is downloaded twice. The
default action is <guilabel>Download mail</guilabel> to prevent the
loss of messages.</para>

<warning><para>Be careful with the <guilabel>Delete mail from
server</guilabel> option since once a mail is deleted on the server
there is no way to get it back.</para></warning>

<para>With a really good set of filter rules, it is possible that all
messages that exceed the threshold size are automatically tagged
(&ie; downloaded, kept on the server or deleted) and you would never
be bugged by the confirmation dialog. Be careful though, since once a
message is matched by a filter rule, you have no guarantee that you
can change the action before it is executed: the confirmation dialog will
be displayed <emphasis>only</emphasis> if there is a message left that
was not matched by a filter rule.</para>

<sect2 id="popfilters-dialog">
<title>The <guilabel>Configure Pop Filter</guilabel> Dialog</title>

<para>Adding filter rules works similar as for <link
linkend="filters">message  filters</link>. On the left hand side you
can manage the existing filters. Use the <guiicon>New</guiicon>
button to add a filter. On the right hand side you can configure
under which conditions the current filter should match. Using <guilabel>Filter

matched by this rule. The available options are:</para>

<variablelist>

<para>Will download the messages matched by the filter, just as any other message
that does not exceed the threshold size.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Download mail later</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>Will tag the messages for later download. This means the messages matched

changing the action manually.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Delete mail from server</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>Will delete the message from the server and does not download it. Once you
deleted a message from the server, there is <emphasis>no</emphasis> way you can undo this.
Be careful, as rules could match messages you actually want, too.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>

<para>The option <guilabel>Always show matched 'Download Later' messages in
confirmation  dialog</guilabel> will cause the confirmation dialog to
show up during mailbox check if at least one message was tagged for
<guilabel>Download Later</guilabel> - even if all messages exceeding
the threshold size were matched by a rule. This option is useful in the
case you have messages matched by a rule and tagged for
<guilabel>Download Later</guilabel>, but you do not get any message
exceeding the size limit for a very long time. Without this option,
the confirmation dialog would never show up and you would never have
a chance to get the queued message by changing the action manually.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="popfilters-confirmation">
<title>The Confirmation Dialog</title>

<para>This dialog shows up whenever you have POP filtering switched
on and  messages were found on the server that exceed the threshold
size you defined for the POP account. Now you have the chance to
decide what you want to do with that message. The options are
<guilabel>Download</guilabel> (green), <guilabel>Download
later</guilabel> (yellow with egg watch) and <guilabel>Delete from
server</guilabel> (red <quote>X</quote>). Be cautious with the delete
option, since once you deleted a mail from the server, there is no
way to undelete it again.</para>

<para>In the <guilabel>Filtered Messages</guilabel> section you can
check the box if you receive messages that were automatically tagged for
a certain action (download, download later, delete) by a filter rule.
The checkbox is only enabled if you receive some messages that were
matched by a filter rule; once you check it, a list similar to the
one for the not-automatically-tagged messages will be displayed and you
can change the action for every single message.</para>

<para>Please note that if there is a message exceeding the size
limit, but all messages are matched by a filter rule the dialog will
not be displayed. One exception occurs if you have checked
<guilabel>Always show matched 'Download Later' messages</guilabel> in
the <guilabel>Global Options</guilabel> section of the POP filter
configuration dialog; then, the dialog will also be displayed if you only

<title>Signing and Encrypting Messages with <application>PGP</application>
or <application>GnuPG</application></title>

<note><para>There have been major changes in the way &kmail; handles
signing/encryption. The following introduction applies to the previous
version of &kmail;. You can still read the introduction to get an overview
about how to sign/encrypt messages, but the details, especially those of
the configuration, will differ.</para></note>

<para>This is a short introduction on how to setup &kmail;'s
<application>PGP</application> (<application>Pretty Good Privacy</application>) support;
it gives some hints on the use of
<application>PGP</application> too. It is written for people who are beginners in
this area; if you are familiar with the use of <application>PGP</application>, you can
skip most of the steps. This documentation, and the &kmail; user interface,
generally talk only about  <quote>PGP</quote>, but it applies to
both <application>PGP</application> and <application>GnuPG</application>
(<application>GNU Privacy Guard</application>),
(although some <application>GnuPG</application> command-line parameters
may be different.)</para>

<para>Please
also check out the <link linkend="pgp-faq">&FAQ; item about
<application>PGP</application></link>.</para>

<warning><para>Attachments will not be signed/encrypted if you are using
inline OpenPGP: to sign/encrypt attachments, you have to install GnuPG and
some necessary libraries;
then, you can decide for each attachment whether it should be signed/encrypted or not.
</para></warning>

<warning><para>&kmail; has to rely on <application>PGP</application>'s
output; this output is often different between different versions of
<application>PGP</application>, so it is important that you test if encryption
really works with your setup before you start using it seriously. &kmail; might
<emphasis>not</emphasis> warn you if something fails -- enable
<guilabel>Show signed/encrypted text
after composing</guilabel>.  </para></warning>

<para>To setup and use <application>PGP</application> support in &kmail; it is
necessary to have <application>PGP</application> installed and set up
properly; of course, we cannot give you a full introduction of
<application>PGP</application> here. We will only mention the steps you have to
do to get <application>PGP</application> going. For details you should have a look at
the excellent  <application>PGP</application> documentation
or <ulink url="http://www.gnupg.org/docs.html#guides">The GNU Privacy Handbook</ulink>.</para>

<para>It is certainly a good idea to study this documentation as well as an
introduction into public key cryptography (&eg; out of the
<application>PGP</application> 6.5.x package): there you can learn a lot about
the basic concepts, which will help you to understand what is going on; also,
many security related issues you should know about are discussed there.</para>

<para>Now, let us start.</para>

<sect2 id="pgp-preconditions">
<title>Preconditions</title>

<para>&kmail; expects that your <application>PGP</application> binary is called
<command>pgp</command>; in the case of <application>GnuPG</application>, it expects
the binary to be called <command>gpg</command>. If this is not the case for you,
just make a symlink.</para>

<para>If you have not done so, you have to generate a key pair (secret and public
key) for your identity. You must do this at the command line: use
<userinput><command>pgp</command> <option>-kg</option></userinput>
or <userinput><command>gpg</command> <option>--gen-key</option></userinput>: &kmail;
has no internal support for <application>pgp</application>'s key generation at
this time. The identity (normally your name followed by your email address
within brackets, such as <userinput>John Doe
&lt;john@example.com&gt;</userinput>) and your passphrase are important for the
co-operation between &kmail; and <application>PGP</application>.</para>

</sect2>

<para>Here you can choose if you want to use <application>PGP</application>,

<para>When this option is off, &kmail; will ask for your passphrase each
time you sign a message (before sending) or select an encrypted message;
if you turn this option on, &kmail; will remember your passphrase from
after your first successful input until you finish your &kmail; session. The
passphrase is stored in memory and not written to the hard disk.
If you use one of the Crypto-Plugins or if you use <application>GnuPG</application>
with the gpg-agent then an external program will ask for your passphrase and
optionally remember it for some time.</para>

</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Always encrypt to self</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>If this option is off and you want to send an encrypted message to somebody,
then you cannot read this message any longer after you have composed and
encrypted it. Turn this option on to keep sent encrypted messages readable for
you too.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Show signed/encrypted text after composing</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>This will show you the result of encrypting and signing before the message
gets sent; this way, you can still cancel sending if encrypting failed. It is
strongly recommended to use this option.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Always show the encryption keys for approval</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>This will always open a dialog that lets you choose the keys used for
each recipient when you are sending an encrypted message; if this
option is off, &kmail; will show this dialog only when it cannot
find a key for a recipient or when there are conflicting or unset encryption
preferences.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Automatically sign messages using OpenPGP</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>This lets you toggle whether to automatically sign your messages

the icon in the composer window.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Automatically encrypt messages whenever possible</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>If this option is on, &kmail; will automatically encrypt messages
with the built-in OpenPGP support or the PGP/MIME-Plugin provided that,
for every recipient, a trusted PGP key is found in your keyring and
you did not tell &kmail; not to encrypt messages sent to
certain recipients. If in doubt, &kmail; will ask whether the message
should be encrypted or not.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

to do this go to the <link linkend="configure-identity">Identities configuration</link>
and set the key that should be used on the <guilabel>Advanced</guilabel> tab of the
identity configuration.</para>

<para>Now you are able to sign outgoing messages; to let people send you
encrypted messages and to let them verify your signature you
must send them your public key or upload your public key to a public
<application>PGP</application> key server so that they can fetch your key from there.
To send encrypted messages to other people or to verify their signed
messages you will need their public keys;  you can store your public key(s) on a

<para>You can compose your message as usual in the composer
window of &kmail;. Before you send the message, check the <guiicon>Sign Message</guiicon>

the message. The identity you are using to write the current message needs to
be connected to an <guilabel>OpenPGP Key</guilabel> in the <guilabel>Identity</guilabel>

this message for the recipient in question.
Using the <guilabel>Remember choice</guilabel>

<para>If you are using a key for the first time, there are conflicting
Encryption Preferences, or if <guilabel>Always

then, choose, in the composer window's menu,
<menuchoice><guimenu>Attach</guimenu><guimenuitem>Attach My Public

<para>Remember that it is not safe at all if you sign the message to make sure
that the receiver will get the correct key: there can be a man-in-the-middle
attack, as somebody can change the key and sign the message with that other
key. That is why the recipient should verify the attached key by checking the
key's fingerprint against the one he received in a secure way from you; have a look
at the <application>PGP</application> documentation for further details.</para>

<para>You can receive a public key as an attachment or via http, ftp or a floppy.
Before you can use this key to encrypt a message to the owner of the
key, you should verify the key (check its fingerprint or look for
trusted signatures); then, you can add this key to your public keyring
by typing <userinput><command>pgp</command> <option>-ka</option>
<replaceable>filename</replaceable></userinput> at the command line (if you are using

<para>The wizard scans for known anti-spam tools on your computer.
It is as well possible to use results of spam checks made by your provider
by evaluating some header information which has been added to the messages.
You can let the wizard prepare &kmail; to use one or many of them in parallel.
However, note that anti-spam tool operations are usually time consuming.
&kmail; can appear to be frozen during the scan of the messages for spam,
you may encounter problems with the responsiveness of &kmail;. Please consider
deleting the filter rules created by the wizard if the filtering becomes
too slow for you.
Here are some recommendations regarding the supported tools:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
  <term>Bogofilter</term>
<listitem>
<para>Bogofilter is a bayesian filter, that means it's spam detection
relies on an initial training phase. On the other hand, it's a pretty
fast tool. That's why it is recommended to be used by people which
primarily want to have a fast spam detection, and which don't worry
about the little training in the beginning before the detection rate
increases significantly.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
  <term>SpamAssassin</term>
<listitem>
<para>SpamAssassin is a pretty complex tool to fight against spam.
Although it's behavior depends heavily on it's configuration, that
tool can detect spam quite well without any training. However,
scanning a message takes a little longer compared to pure bayesian
filters. Let's say, it's not the tool of choice for people without
some background information about SpamAssassin's capabilities.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
  <term>Annoyance-Filter</term>
<listitem>
<para>Perhaps not so often used until distributions pick it up.
It's clearly a tool for specialists.

  <term>GMX Spam Filter</term>
<listitem>
<para>Given that you get your mail via the GMX freemail provider,
your messages are scanned for spam. The result of that process is
documented in a special header field of each message. It's possible to
use the content of this header field to sort out spam. There is no
slowdown in the filtering if only this tool is used, as the messages
have already been processed.

<title>Advanced</title>

<para>Here are the details of how the wizard works: &kmail; can use several
external tools to detect spam messages; it will try to automatically find
out which of those tools are installed on your box and will show you these
tools in a list. The list is ordered by the average speed of the filtering
process of the tools. You can mark the tools which you want
to be used by &kmail; to detect spam. Of course, you
can close the wizard, install a tool, and restart the wizard again.
</para>

<para>If you have marked at least one tool, KMail is able to provide filters
which allow the classification of the messages as spam or not spam. It will
also provide actions to let you manually classify messages. These actions will
be available via the menu and via toolbar icons.
If any of the tools you selected support Bayesian filtering (&ie; a method
to detect spam based on statistical analysis of the messages) then these
messages are not only marked but additionally transfered to the tools to
let them learn so they can improve their detection rate.
</para>

<para>On the second page, there you will be able to select some additional
actions to be done in &kmail; with regard to spam messages: if you
want messages detected as spam to be moved into a certain folder, please select
the appropriate folder and mark the <guilabel>Move known spam to:</guilabel>
option; if messages detected as spam should additionally be marked as read,
then mark the <guilabel>Mark detected spam messages as read</guilabel> option.
</para>

<para>Having checked at least one of the available tools will allow you to
let the wizard finish the filter setup. The wizard will not take any
modifications in existing filters formerly created by the wizard into
consideration but will either append new filters or replace existing filters
in any case; you may want to inspect the result of this process in the
<link linkend="filter-dialog">Filter Dialog</link>.
The wizard will also create toolbar buttons for marking messages as spam or
as ham; keep in mind that classifying messages as spam will also move those
messages to the folder you had specified for spam messages, if you haven't
deselected the appropriate option.
</para>

<sect2 id="spam-wizard-details">
<title>Some More Details for Experts</title>

<para>The wizard uses information stored in a special configuration file named
<filename>kmail.antispamrc</filename> (stored in the global or local KDE
config directory). It will first check the global config file and then the local
config file: if the local config file contains entries with higher (newer)
version numbers per-tool the configuration data from the local file for that
tool is used; that way, both administrators and users can update the
wizard configuration.
</para>

<para>The local detection of spam messages is achieved by creating
<guilabel>pipe through</guilabel> actions per-tool within a
special filter. Another filter contains rules to check for detected spam
messages and actions to mark them and (optionally, depending on the choice
in the wizard) to move them into a folder. Both filters are configured to
be applied on incoming messages and on manual filtering.
</para>

<para>Two filters are needed for the classification of ham and spam. They
contain actions to mark the messages appropriately. As mentioned above, the filter
for classification as spam can have another action to move the message into a
predefined folder. If the selected tools support Bayesian filtering,
the wizard will create additional filter actions to pass the messages to the
tools (via <guilabel>execute command</guilabel> actions) in the
appropriate learn mode.
