<P>This is a short introduction to Kmail and its usage so you can start
working with it right away. For more in-depth information see the 
<A HREF="index-3.html#sec-UsingKmail">Using Kmail</A> section.
<P>Invoking Kmail for the first time creates a Mail directory containing the initial
files (inbox, outbox, sent-mail, and trash) in your home directory.  Kmail then pops up
the Settings window where you must enter some initial information so Kmail will 
be able to properly retrieve and send your messages. 
<P>The Settings window consists of six tabs: <B>Identity</B>, <B>Network</B>, <B>Appearance</B>, 
<B>Composer</B>, <B>Misc</B>, and <B>PGP</B>. 
To begin sending and receiving email you will only have to change the
settings in the <B>Identity</B> and <B>Network</B> tabs.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Setting your Identity</A>
</H3>

<P>The settings in the <B>Identity</B> tab are fairly straightforward. Fill in the <B>Name</B>
and <B>Organization</B> fields with the appropriate information if you want this
information to be automatically included in the headers of any message that you send.
Next, fill in the <B>Email Address</B> and the <B>Reply-to Address</B> field 
with your email address. Finally, set the location of your signature file in the
<B>Signature File</B> field. You can skip setting the signature file if you do not
have one, but every time you compose a new message, Kmail will ask you for your
signature file.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Setting up your Account</A>
</H3>

<P>The <B>Network</B> tab contains the settings that tell Kmail how to send and receive your
email. Many of these settings can vary greatly depending on the setup of your system
and on the kind of network that your mail server is located. If you do not know what
setting to pick or what to put in a field, consult your Internet Service Provider
(ISP) or System Administrator.
<P>
<H4>Sending Mail</H4>

<P> 
The <B>Sending Mail</B> section provides two options for sending mail:
sendmail and SMTP. Sendmail has a reputation of being difficult to set up, so if you
do not already have a working sendmail configuration, choose SMTP and fill in the
<B>Server</B> field with the name and domain of your mail server. You will probably
not need to change the <B>Port</B> setting.
<P>
<H4>Receiving Mail</H4>

<P>To set up an account so you can receive mail, press the <B>Add...</B> button in the
<B>Incoming Mail</B> section. You will then be prompted for the type of account.
Most users should select <B>POP3</B>. (IMAP accounts are not supported) After
pressing <B>OK</B> you will be presented with the <B>Configure Account</B>
window. First, fill in the <B>Name</B> field to name your account. <B>Login</B>,
<B>Password</B>, and <B>Host</B> should be filled in with the appropriate
information from your ISP or System Administrator. Again, you should not need to
change the <B>Port</B> setting. Finally, select <B>Delete mail from server</B> if
you don't want to leave your mail on the server. Leave the account's mailbox set to
inbox for now, although you may want to change it if you add more accounts later.
<P>You are now ready to send and receive mail!
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Testing Your Setup</A>
</H3>

<P>First, we will send an email to test our configuration. To send an email, hit 
Control-N, or select the <B>File | New Composer</B> menu item.  The <B>Composer</B> 
window will appear. Fill in the <B>To:</B> field with your email address and type
something in the <B>subject</B> field.  Send the mail by selecting <B>File | Send</B>.
<P>To check your email, select <B>File | Check Mail...</B> A window will pop up and indicate how much mail is being 
downloaded. If you receive the message you just sent, then congratulations!
If, however, you receive any error messages
while testing your setup, make sure that your network connection is working and
recheck your settings by selecting <B>File | Settings...</B>
