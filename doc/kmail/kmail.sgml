<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KMail
<p>
KMail is a base application of the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
KMail can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp site
of the KDE project, in the kdebase distribution.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KMail, you need the latest versions of 
<tt> kdesupport</tt> and <tt> kdelibs</tt>. You will also need
<tt>automake</tt> and <tt>autoconf</tt>. All required libraries & apps can be 
found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 



<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KMail on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the KMail distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% make -f Makefile.cvs
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>


Since KMail uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the <sf/KDE/ mailing lists.

<sect>Fundamentals
<p>
The main screen is devided into 3 parts:
1. The folder widget (upper left widget).
2. The mail header widget (upper right widget).
3. The reader widget (lower widget).

Clicking a folder will open it and display the messages in the header widget.
Clicking one of the headers will make the message appear in the reader widget.

<p>
<sect1>Folders and Accounts
<p>
KMail allows you to have multiple folders and accounts. The philosophy is that you have certain accounts connected to certain folders so if you open a folder and try to get new mail it will automatically open the connection to the bouned account. You can easily create, modify & delete folders and accounts via the menubar items.
<p>
<sect>Features
<p>
<sect1>Drag and Drop
<p>
KMail makes use of the KDE Drag and Drop protocol. This means that you can darg
and drop message form the header widget to your desktop or drop attachments on the composer to be automatically attached.
<p>

<sect1>Pretty good privacy
