<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 How do I use my (Eudora, XFmail, other random mail client) mailboxes in Kmail?</A>
</H2>

<P>See the section 
<A HREF="index-5.html#sec-Importing">Using other Mailbox files With Kmail</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 How do I leave mail on the server? (from the KDE FAQ)</A>
</H2>

<P>Open up the Settings window from the file menu. Click on the Network tab. Select your account from the account list and click the
Modify button. This dialog contains the "Delete mail from server" setting which you must not select. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 How do I automatically insert a text footer within the mail? (from the KDE FAQ)</A>
</H2>

<P>The text footer is called a signature file. What you need to do is open up a text editor (like kedit) and type in what you want to appear
in the footer. Save the file under a name like signature or footer. Go into Kmail and select <B>File |
Settings...</B> Look in the "Identity" tab
for the "signature file" field. Click on the ellipses button and select the file you just created.
Now Kmail will automatically insert that file in any message you write.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Why does Kmail keep asking me for the location of my signature file? I</A>
don't have/want one!</H2>

<P>Kmail will ask you the location of your signature file if you have checked the
option <B>Automatically Append Signature</B> in the <B>Composer</B> tab of
the <B>Settings</B> dialog, but have not specified a signature file in the
<B>Identity</B> tab. You should either specify a signature file or uncheck
<B>Automatically Append Signature</B>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Why doesn't word wrap work in the</A>
Composer window? </H2>

<P>The word wrap setting is probably turned off. Word wrap can be toggled on and off in the 
<B>Composer</B> tab of the <B>Settings</B> dialog box.
