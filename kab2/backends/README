Test backend(s) for kab2.

A 'backend' is used to do the actual data storage and retrieval. This may
involve something as simple as reading/writing text files, or storing KConfig
entries, using a GDBM database, or even talking to an LDAP server.

See the README in each subdir for notes on each implementation.

Comments, questions etc. should be directed to Rik <rik@kde.org>
