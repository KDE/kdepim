Test program for kab2.

This program uses only the kab2 library to do all its work. As you will be able
to see from the code, there is no need to know about anything going on behind
the scenes.

The code is extremely simple and the API is documented in the pim/kab2/doc
directory.

Questions, comments etc. should be directed to Rik <rik@kde.org>
