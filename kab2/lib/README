Test implementation of kab2.

Notes:

* Everything is within the 'KAB' namespace.

* Clients should create an object of Kab2 and use this to discover which
  addressbooks are available.

* When you ask a Kab2 object for a list of addressbooks, you get a list of
  AddressBookClient. These provide the for writing, retrieving, finding, etc.

* To add a new record you can do something like this:
  
  KAB::AddressBookClient  * client = addressBookList.at(0);
  KAB::Entity             * entity = new KAB::Entity;

  char d[10] = "Test data";
  QByteArray data;
  data.setRawData(d, 10);
  
  entity->add("TestFieldName", data);
  
  data.resetRawData(d, 10);
  
  bool retval = client->write(e);
