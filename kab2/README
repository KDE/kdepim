Test design + implementation for kab2.

Look at README in each subdir for notes about each component.

Look in the doc directory for related documentation.

Source documentation (for lib/) is not complete yet, but there's some in
there you may find useful.

Note that source documentation doesn't work right using kdoc because kdoc
doesn't support namespaces. There's a doxygen config file in lib which you can
use instead if you have doxygen.

Documentation generated with kdoc goes in doc/srcdoc (but is currently useless).
Documentation generated with doxygen goes in doc/srcdox.

Use 'make doc' in lib/ to generate kdoc documentation.
Use 'make dox' in lib/ to generate doxygen documentation.

Contact Rik <rik@kde.org> with any questions, comments etc.
