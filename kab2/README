Test design + implementation for KabII

Look in the doc directory for related documentation. Note that some of
this documentation may be incorrect and/or out of date. The design is
changing rapidly !

Source documentation (for lib/) is not complete yet, but there's some in
there you may find useful.

Note that source documentation doesn't work right using kdoc because it doesn't
support namespaces. There's a doxygen config file in lib which you can use
instead if you have doxygen.

Documentation generated with kdoc goes in doc/srcdoc (but is currently useless).
Documentation generated with doxygen goes in doc/srcdox.

Use 'make doc' in lib/ to generate kdoc documentation.
Use 'make dox' in lib/ to generate doxygen documentation.
