Test implementation of a kab server.

Notes:

* You can start one (or more) of these on any machine accessible from your
  client.

* To start it, use kab_server <format> <location>, where <location> is an URL.
  The simplest form is probably 'kab_server gdbm /tmp/kab'.
  This will create an AddressBook object which loads a plugin to handle gdbm
  format data, and which uses /tmp/kab as its data store.

* Requests are served on port 6566 (ASCII 'AB').

* The server fork()s on each incoming connection.

* Locking is non-existant at the moment.

* Documentation describing the protocol used is in ../doc
