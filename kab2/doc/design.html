<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>
The addressbook provided with KDE 1 was useful and provided enough features
to please most users. The design of KAB 1 was, however, too simple to provide
for features such as multiple addressbooks, remote addressbooks and filter
plugins (for importing from other formats).
</P>
<P>
The design of KAB 2 is intended to make use of the advanced mechanisms provided
by KDE 2. In the future it is hoped that access to kab2 may be provided via
CORBA communication. This would give excellent network transparency while
preserving a useful API.
</P>

<H4>Description</H4>
<P>
KAB 2 will be a distributed system. A simple shared library will provide the
API for applications. This library will know about the addressbooks that the
user wishes to access. The library will contact the addressbooks upon startup
and query them to discover whether they are usable at that time. Any usable
addressbooks will appear in the user interface, and be accessible through
the API.
</P>
<P>
Addressbooks will be communicated with via DCOP. A standard protocol will be
used that provides a consistent interface and allows for accessing entities
within each addressbook. This interface will not be visible to the user nor
the application programmer as it will be hidden behind the API.
</P>
<P>
At any point in time, on user request, an addressbook object may attempt to
import records from an unknown format. To accomplish this, it will attempt
to load a 'filter' plugin. If the plugin is available for the format, and
the data to be imported is available, the plugin will be asked to import
all records from its data source. The plugin will then attempt to create
records within the addressbook by reading its data source and constructing
new records as best as it can.
</P>
