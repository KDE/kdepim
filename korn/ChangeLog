  * More porting to KDE/Qt 2. Shitloads to do, took all day :(
  * Compiles cleanly with -DQT_NO_ASCII_CAST -DQT_NO_CAST_ASCII
    -DQT_CLEAN_NAMESPACE
  * Used an inline function called 'fu()' to convert all (const) char * to
    QString. It calles QString::fromUtf8(), hence 'f(from)u(tf8)'.

2000-06-12 Rik Hemsley <rik@kde.org>
	* Minor icon fix.
  * Fixes to kornbutt.

2000-06-12 Rik Hemsley <rik@kde.org>
	* Fixed enabling of buttons and initial selection in optdlg.
	* Converted C-style casts to C++-style, and checked retvals
	  of dynamic_casts. Currently only assert() used, but that's
	  better than crashing.
	* Fixed layout of polldlg.
	* Split 'General' cfg widget into two, 'View' and 'Commands'
	* Added some keyboard accelerators.
	* Still need to connect config stuff up properly...

2000-06-09 Rik Hemsley <rik@kde.org>
	* Converted the dialogs to use KDialogBase etc.
	* Changed 'Options' to 'Display' and moved to second place in
	  main config dialog.

	* temporarily take care of korn (with Taj's blessing)
	* fix most of the layouts (/me being too stupid to fix Taj's nice
		custom layout classes, I switched completely to pure QLayouts)
	* fixed most of the i18n
	* made FileDialogs start with the current path by default (instead no
		path, used before)
	* changed some UI details a it (repetitive "Box" word etc.)
	* added the Cancel button to the main QTabDialog of Setup...
	NOTICE: kornII always functioned correctly. My changes are only makeup
