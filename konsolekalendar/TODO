Big architectural break-down
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Event class parent class and make konsokalendarvariables as child class
Move all showing code to konsolekalendarexports
Move HTML to own method
Remote calendar support (this should be done smoothly like you write 
fish://some.com/mycalendar you get you calendar). This should be done
in some separated lib..
Parsing args to own methods (from main)
Clean up starting sequence. (separate sane checks)
Re-think Whole GPL-QT clause! (Tuukka:)
