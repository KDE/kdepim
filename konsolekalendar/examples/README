Here are some nice example scripts how to use konsolekalendar.

 * tcm2kcal.pl
   Parses TCM (Turner Classic Movies) schedule from the web site to ICS
   You need lynx and the Date::Calc to use this script
   (you can install Date::Calc using 'perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Calc')

 * testkalendar.sh is crappy test script..
