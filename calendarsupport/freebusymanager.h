      Retrieve the freebusy information of somebody else, i.e. it will not try
      to download our own freebusy information.

      This method will first try to find Akonadi resource that have the
      'FreeBusyProvider' capablity set. If none is found then there is a fallback
      on the URL mechanism (see below). If at least one is found then it will
      be first queried over D-Bus to know if it can handle free-busy information
      for that email address. If true then it will be queried for the free-busy
      data for a period ranging from today to today plus 14 days, defined in
      FreeBusyManagerPrivate::FreeBusyProvidersRequestsQueue::FreeBusyProvidersRequestsQueue()
      as hard-coded magic value. If the Akonadi resource responds successfully
      (still over D-Bus) then the freeBusyRetrieved signal is emitted. If any
      of those steps then the URL mechanism will be used as a fallback.

      The URL mechanism makes use of a local cache, if the information
      for a given email is already downloaded it will return the information
      from the cache. The free-busy information must be accessible using HTTP
      and the URL is build dynamically from the email address and the global
      groupware settings.

      The call is asynchronous, a download is started in the background (if
      needed) and freeBusyRetrieved will be emitted when the download is finished.
