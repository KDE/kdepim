How to run performance tests.

Since the test data file with the items imported from Akregator
weights about 25MB it is hosted at my server http://partimage-ng.net.
The file contains 9000+ RSS items.

There are two performance tests:

1. ItemImportReader test measures the performance of the item
   reader's parser.

2. ImportItemsJob test measures how fast the items get imported
   into Akonadi.

I cannot figure out why the tests don't print the benchmark results
when run non-interactive so here's the steps how to run them manually.

1. Go to tests/
2. Run './gettestdata.sh' (will download planetkde-performance.xml from
   partimage-ng.net)
3. Run 'akonaditest -c unitestenv/config2.xml -testenv testenv.sh &'
   (start the Akonadi test environment)
4. Run 'source ./testenv.sh'
5. Go to the build dir ('cb' if using dfaure's bashrc functions)
6. Run the test './itemimportreadertest.shell' and then
   './importitemsjobtest.shell'
7. Wait for the results :-)
8. Run 'shutdown-testenvironment'

If planetkde-performance.xml is not found in tests/unittestenv/kdehome2/
the tests will be skipped.
