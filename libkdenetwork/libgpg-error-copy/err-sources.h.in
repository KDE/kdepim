# Everything up to the first line that starts with a number in the
# first column is copied into the output verbatim.  Then, empty lines
# are ignored.  Other lines must have an error code number, followed
# by exactly one <tab>, followed by the error message.  Trailing
# whitespace is removed.  The error sources should be sorted.  The
# last line should not have a number, but only a <tab>, followed by a
# description for error sources that are not in the list.
