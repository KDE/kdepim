 The class PrintStyle implements the abstract interface to the
 PrintingWizards style objects.
 To implement a print style, derive from this class and read
 the information in printingwizard.h to see how this two pieces
 work together. Basically, the print style gets the contacts it
 is supposed to print from the PrintingWizard is will not
 change this set - neither its content nor its order.
 To register your new style in the printing wizard, you need to
 define a PrintStyleFactory that handles how your objects are
 created and deleted. See the existing print styles for
 examples.
 A print style should have a preview image that gives the user
 a basic impression on how it will look. Add this image to the
 printing folder (right here :-), and edit Makefile.am to have
 it installed along with kaddressbook. Load it using
 setPreview(QString).
 Your print style is supposed to add its options as pages to
 the printing wizard. The method wizard() gives you a pointer
 to the wizard object.
