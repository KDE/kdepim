The Scalix Resource is based on the code of the Kolab resource as both
groupware servers use a similar storage concept (storing pim items as
email attachments on an IMAP server).

However the Scalix Resource has several modifications, e.g. the XML storage
type was removed and freebusy handling is done via a separated KIO slave.
