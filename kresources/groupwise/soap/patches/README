gSoap Patches
=============

This directory contains patches for gSoap required to make the GroupWise
resource work with the real existing GroupWise server. They are already included
in the gSoap or gSoap generated files in CVS, so if you don't create the stubs
yourself or want to upgrade the gSoap version you don't have to care about these
patches.

Patch descriptions
------------------

broken_namespace.diff:

  The GroupWise server doesn't correctly declare the default namespace. This
  patch disables the namespace checking for the GroupWise namespace ns1.

utf8_entities.diff:

  gSoap encodes utf8 characters as XML entities, but the server doesn't seem to
  be able to decode them. This patch makes gSoap send unencoded utf8 characters.
