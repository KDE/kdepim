This directory contains the bindings for the Groupwise SOAP interface. They
consist of generated binding classes and and the classes encapsulating
the SOAP for use by KDE programs.

The bindings are generated with gSoap 2.7.0d (see
http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html) from the WSDL description in the file
groupwise.wsdl. Generate the stub classes and
interface implementations by calling "make stubs". The gSoap binaries have to be
in your PATH for this.

FIXME: The generated code produces lots of compiler warnings. They should be 
properly fixed as "[t]he generated code is not safe, so the warnings are correct,
even if we currently use it in a way which works." (Cornelius Schumacher)
