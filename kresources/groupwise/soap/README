This directory contains the bindings for the Groupwise SOAP interface. They
consist of generated binding classes and the classes encapsulating
the SOAP for use by KDE programs.

The bindings are generated with gSoap 2.7.0d (see
http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html) from the WSDL description in the file
groupwise.wsdl. Generate the stub classes and
interface implementations by calling "make stubs". The gSoap binaries have to be
in your PATH for this.

FIXME: The generated code produces lots of compiler warnings. They should be 
properly fixed as "[t]he generated code is not safe, so the warnings are correct,
even if we currently use it in a way which works." (Cornelius Schumacher)

*) "Validation constraint violation: data type mismatch  in element <gwt:security>"

is caused by gSoap's inablity to parse gwt:security tags, creating a spurious error.  It can be fixed by editing soapC.cpp by hand and changing soap_s2ngwt__ItemSecurity(), at about lines
12490 in the generated code,

Comment out the s2QName call and change the last param to soap_code to s
//soap_s2QName(soap, s, &t);
map = soap_code(soap_codes_ngwt__ItemSecurity, s);

*) "delete" in generated code. 

The GroupWise WSDL uses the reserved word "delete" in two contexts.  gSOAP is not smart enough to catch this and rewrite it, so you have to do this by hand.  AgeAction and DeltaSyncType are the two types affected by this, so make sure you are consistent in renaming them.  There is a sed call in Makefile.am/stubs but this does not catch all cases.
