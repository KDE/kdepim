/**
  This class provides the kmail connectivity for IMAP resources.

  The main methods are:

  fromKMail...() : calls made _by_ KMail to add/delete data representation in the resource.

  kmail...()     : calls _into_ KMail made by the resource.

  e.g. fromKMailAddIncidence() is called by KMail
       when a new iCard is there after an IMAP sync.

       By calling fromKMailAddIncidence() KMail notifies
       the resource about the new incidence, so in the
       addressbook a new address will appear like magic.

  e.g. kmailAddIncidence() is called by the resource when
       iCard must be stored by KMail because the user has added
       an address in the addressbook.

       By calling kmailAddIncidence() the resource causes
       KMail to store the new address in the (IMAP) folder.
