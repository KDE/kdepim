kresources/lib (general):
===============
-) http result code handling (404, 200, etc.)
-) conflict resolution
-) Error handling in the folder lister (cannot connect to host, timeout, etc.)
-) turn the flat folder list into a folder tree
-) Restore folder subscriptions on folder list refresh
-) If the user cancels, we need to reset the mUploadJob variable to 0 in the 
   abook resource.
-) if there's an item in the local cache that cannot be bound on the server and
   in the idMapper, mark it as added and try to upload it on save!
-) reload libkcal resources in korganizer when config changes
-) Use the username / password entered into the config dlg. For some reason 
   each ioslave asks again with a password dialog...
-) If upload fails, mark the item as changed/added/deleted again
-) Don't ask immediately for uploading in korganizer, wait at least a 
   QTimer::singleShot
-) Better progress bar messages


kresources/newexchange:
=======================
-) handling of errors returned in a valid dav response (Exchange)
-) recurrences on exchange
-) timezone for exchange
-) exdate on exchange
-) notifications from the server (old exchange resource has it!)
-) In Exchange abook: if an address is removed, store the empty string to the
   server to delete the data from the server
-) Journal upload not working


kresources/groupdav:
====================
-) recurrences on ogo
-) uploading abook entries don't work (server doesn't implement it yet)
-) Overview and Calendar have the same items -> downloaded every time (same 
   uid, different href, only one of them can be in the local cache -> the other
   one is downloaded and replaces the current item, so on next folder sync the
   first item is downloaded again and replaces the other one...)


kresources/blogging:
====================
-) Upload of blog posts
