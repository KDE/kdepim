 the now ubiquitous Microsoft Outlook, Starfish Internet Sidekick,
 Time & Chaos, etc. (all for the Microsoft Windows platform, of course.) Best
 of all, It reads and writes the vCalendar file format NATIVELY (please see
 http://www.imc.org/pdi for more information), which is now an industry-wide
 personal data interchange format. Because of this, you should be able to move
 from other modern PIMs to KOrganizer with relative ease. Current users of the
 popular program ical should definitely take a look at KOrganizer and compare
 features.
 .
 KOrganizer also offers full synchronization with your Palm Pilot, if you have
 kpilot installed.
