 of all, It reads and writes the vCalendar file format NATIVELY (please see
 http://www.imc.org/pdi for more information), which is now an industry-wide
 personal data interchange format. Because of this, you should be able to move
 from other modern PIMs to KOrganizer with relative ease. Current users of the

 features.
