Description: KDE personal organizer
 A complete calendar and scheduling program. KOrganizer supports information

 KOrganizer aims to be a complete program for organizing your appointments,
 contacts, projects, etc. It is in the same spirit as similar programs like
 the now ubiquitous Microsoft Outlook, Starfish Internet Sidekick,
 Time & Chaos, etc. (all for the Microsoft Windows platform, of course.) Best
 of all, It reads and writes the vCalendar file format NATIVELY (please see
 http://www.imc.org/pdi for more information), which is now an industry-wide
 personal data interchange format. Because of this, you should be able to move
 from other modern PIMs to KOrganizer with relative ease. Current users of the
 popular program ical should definitely take a look at KOrganizer and compare
 features.
