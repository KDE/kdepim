KDE NOTICE
==========

There used to be two versions of kde.deb : one made by debian, and
one made by the KDE team. Fortunatly this has changed to the better
and this package is both: the debian package and the kde package.

Andreas Jellinghaus <aj@debian.org> used to maintain the debian part
and Stephan Kulow took them over, when he orphaned them.

Since then Ivan Moore has been working on them with Stephan's guidance
and has just recently taken them over completely.
