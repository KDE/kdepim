Anything relating to the KDE-PIM project.

The KDE-PIM project aims to bring together those who wish to help design,
implement, test, etc. anything that's to do with personal information
management.

This rather broad scope encompasses mail clients, addressbooks, usenet news,
scheduling and even sticky notes.

If you'd like to get involved with the project, subscribe to kde-pim@kde.org
with an email to kde-pim-request@kde.org with the subject line:
subscribe my@email.address

The KDE-PIM project home page is at http://without.netpedia.net

Alternatively, contact Rik Hemsley <rik@kde.org> who's pretending to organise
things.

Read 'README' in each individual directory for information pertaining to, er,
that.
