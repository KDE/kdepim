What you find here
------------------

Anything relating to the KDE-PIM project. See also http://pim.kde.org.

The KDE-PIM project aims to bring together those who wish to help design,
implement, test, etc. anything that's to do with personal information
management.

This rather broad scope encompasses mail clients, addressbooks, usenet news,
scheduling and even sticky notes.

What it is
----------

* kaddressbook: The KDE addressbook application.
* kmail: the KDE mail client
* kmailcvt: tool for importing mail related data from other programs
* kmobiletools: an application specially designed to manage mobile phones
* knode: news client
* korganizer: a calendar-of-events and todo-list manager
* kalarm: gui for setting up personal alarm messages, emails and commands
* kalarmd: alarm monitoring daemon, shared by korganizer and kalarm.
* kontact: Integrated PIM application
* ktimetracker: Time tracker.
* kfile-plugins: vCard KFIleItem plugin.
* knotes: yellow notes application
* konsolecalendar: Command line tool for accessing calendar files.
* korn: mail checker
* akregator: Feed reader

There is also quite an amount of infrastructure in this package:

* libkdepim: Common code for different kdepim apps
* mimelib: MIME messages library
* kpgp: A library for pgp
* libkpimexchange: connecting to Exchange2000 servers
* kdgantt: alternative lib for Gantt diagrams, used by the free/busy view of
           KOrganizer (yes, we should decide for one of the Gantt libs)

The following subdirectories have been moved to kdenonbeta/kdepim:

* kab2: another design for the KDE addressbook

* ldif: a parser for LDIF, the LDAP Information Interchange Format
* libdif: dito, one of them is superfluous
* libimap: IMAP handling
