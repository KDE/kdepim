What you find here
------------------

Anything relating to the KDE-PIM project.

The KDE-PIM project aims to bring together those who wish to help design,
implement, test, etc. anything that's to do with personal information
management.

This rather broad scope encompasses mail clients, addressbooks, usenet news,
scheduling and even sticky notes.

What it is
----------

* kandy: sync phone book entries between your cell phone and
computer ("kandy" comes from "Handy", the german word used for a
cellular)
* korganizer: a calendar-of-events and todo-list manager
* kpilot: to sync with your PalmPilot

The following apps are not compiled by default:

* empath: a modular e-mail client, designed for reuse, needs a Qt
with threading support
* twister: another personal information manager, needs empath
* kab2: another design for the KDE addressbook

There is also quite an amount of infrastructure in this package:

* ldif: a parser for LDIF, the LDAP Information Interchange Format
* libdif: dito, one of them is superfluous
* libical: a basic iCalendar protocol implementation, see RFCs 2245,2246
* libimap: IMAP handling
* libkcal: C++ api for the iCalendar and vCalendar formats
* librmm: an Internet mail message parser (RFC 822 -> Class hierarchy)
* vCard: a vCard 3.0 (virtual business card) parser
* kgantt: lib to display and manage Gantt diagrams
