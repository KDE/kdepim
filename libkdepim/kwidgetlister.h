  @short Widget that manages a list of other widgets (incl. 'more', 'fewer' and 'clear' buttons).

  Simple widget that nonetheless does a lot of the dirty work for
  the filter edit widgets (KMSearchPatternEdit and
  KMFilterActionEdit). It provides a growable and shrinkable area
  where widget may be displayed in rows. Widgets can be added by
  hitting the provided 'More' button, removed by the 'Fewer' button
  and cleared (e.g. reset, if an derived class implements that and
  removed for all but @ref mMinWidgets).

  To use this widget, derive from it with the template changed to
  the type of widgets this class should list. Then reimplement @ref
  addWidgetAtEnd, @ref removeLastWidget, calling the original
  implementation as necessary. Instantiate an object of the class and
  put it in your dialog.
