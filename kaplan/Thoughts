Misc:
=====

- Configuration Merge
  Idea: The KOffice way of life: Offer a method that adds a given wiget of a predefined type as page
  in a KDialogBase or offer a pointer to a KDialogBase -> requires a kaplan part or an external lib per part

- Merged Foldertree View
  Idea: Let the part send a description of their folders and reaction to calls as XML, similar to XMLGUI

- Toolbar Items
  The KParts Technology only provides actions for the current part. It might be desireable to have common
  actions that are always available.

- Status Bar
  We need a more sophisticated handling (progressbar, etc)
  
Communication/Interaction:
==========================

- Invoking parts when they are needed for the first time takes too long, starting all takes too long on startup
  Idea: Mark complex parts as basic parts that get loaded anyway

- DCOP is too slow, internal communication should be handled via a dedicated interface, communication with
  external applications (i.e. knotes) should be done via wrapper parts that communicate with their respective 
  IPC method to their application using the native protocol (DCOP, Corba, etc).

- Security: If we use the kparts (ktrader) approach to find a parts by looking for an application
            with the correct mime type this might raise security problems. (Martin's concern)
