     @short A convenience job that additionally fetches all available issuers.

     implementation, connect the progress() and result() signals to
     suitable slots and then start the keylisting with a call to
     start(). This call might fail, in which case the
     HierarchicalKeyListJob instance will have scheduled it's own
     destruction with a call to QObject::deleteLater().

     After result() is emitted, the HierarchicalKeyListJob will
     schedule its own destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
