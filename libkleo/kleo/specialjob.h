  /**
     @short An abstract base class for protocol-specific jobs

     To use a SpecialJob, first obtain an instance from the
     CryptoBackend implementation, connect progress() and result()
     signals to suitable slots and then start the job with a call to
     start(). This call might fail, in which case the SpecialJob
     instance will have schedules its own destruction with a call to
     QObject::deleteLater().

     After result() is emitted, the SpecialJob will schedule its own
     destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().

     Parameters are set using the Qt property system. More general, or
     constructor parameters are given in the call to
     Kleo::CryptoBackend::Protocol::specialJob().

     The result is made available through the result signal, and
     through the read-only result property, the latter of which needs
     to be defined in each SpecialJob subclass.
