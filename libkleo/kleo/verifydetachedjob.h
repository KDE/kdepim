     @short An abstract base class for asynchronous verification of detached signatures

     To use a VerifyDetachedJob, first obtain an instance from the
     CryptoBackend implementation, connect the progress() and result()
     signals to suitable slots and then start the verification with a
     call to start(). This call might fail, in which case the
     VerifyDetachedJob instance will have scheduled it's own
     destruction with a call to QObject::deleteLater().

     After result() is emitted, the VerifyDetachedJob will schedule
     it's own destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
