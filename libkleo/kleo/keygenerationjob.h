     @short An abstract base class for asynchronous key generation

     To use a KeyGenerationJob, first obtain an instance from the
     CryptoBackend implementation, connect the progress() and result()
     signals to suitable slots and then start the key generation with
     a call to start(). This call might fail, in which case the
     KeyGenerationJob instance will have scheduled it's own
     destruction with a call to QObject::deleteLater().

     After result() is emitted, the KeyGenerationJob will schedule it's own
     destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
