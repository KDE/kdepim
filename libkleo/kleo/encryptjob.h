     @short An abstract base class for asynchronous encrypters

     To use a EncryptJob, first obtain an instance from the
     CryptoBackend implementation, connect the progress() and result()
     signals to suitable slots and then start the encryption with a
     call to start(). This call might fail, in which case the
     EncryptJob instance will have scheduled it's own destruction with
     a call to QObject::deleteLater().

     After result() is emitted, the EncryptJob will schedule it's own
     destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
