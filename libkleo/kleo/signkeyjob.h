     CryptoBackend implementation, connect the progress() and result()
     signals to suitable slots and then start the job with a call
     to start(). This call might fail, in which case the ChangeExpiryJob
     instance will have scheduled it's own destruction with a call to
     QObject::deleteLater().

     After result() is emitted, the SignKeyJob will schedule it's own
     destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
