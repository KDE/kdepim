     @short An abstract base class for asynchronous key refreshers.

     To use a RefreshKeysJob, first obtain an instance from the
     CryptoBackend implementation, connect the progress() and result()
     signals to suitable slots and then start the key refresh with a
     call to start(). This call might fail, in which case the
     RefreshKeysJob instance will have scheduled its own destruction
     with a call to QObject::deleteLater().

     After result() is emitted, the KeyListJob will schedule it's own
     destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
