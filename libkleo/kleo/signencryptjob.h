     @short An abstract base class for asynchronous combined signing and encrypting

     To use a SignEncryptJob, first obtain an instance from the
     CryptoBackend implementation, connect the progress() and result()
     signals to suitable slots and then start the operation with a
     call to start(). This call might fail, in which case the
     SignEncryptJob instance will have scheduled it's own destruction
     with a call to QObject::deleteLater().

     After result() is emitted, the SignEncryptJob will schedule it's
     own destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
