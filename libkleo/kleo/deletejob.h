     @short An abstract base class for asynchronous deleters

     To use a DeleteJob, first obtain an instance from the
     CryptoBackend implementation, connect the progress() and result()
     signals to suitable slots and then start the delete with a call
     to start(). This call might fail, in which case the DeleteJob
     instance will have scheduled it's own destruction with a call to
     QObject::deleteLater().

     After result() is emitted, the DeleteJob will schedule it's own
     destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
