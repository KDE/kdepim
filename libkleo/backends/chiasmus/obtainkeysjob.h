     @short SpecialJob for listing Chiasmus key files.

     In the Chiasmus system, keys are mapped 1:1 to
     files. Furthermore, we have to definition of the format of those
     keys, so we cannot display more than the filename anyway. Due to
     all of these limitations, we don't use KeyListJob here, but roll
     our own interface.

     The name of the function is x-obtain-keys. It takes no parameters.

     To use, create an ObtainKeysJob instance like this:
     <code>
     Kleo::SpecialJob * job =
        protocol->specialJob("x-obtain-keys", QMap<QString,QVariant>());
     </code>

     The resulting QVariant will contain a QStringList containing the
     absolute filenames of the keys found in the configured key files.
