    <h1>Welcome to Kontact Touch!</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this document is to provide you a few tips on how to use the Kontact Touch applications (mail, contacts, appointments, tasks and notes). Further information is available at any time on the Internet (see below).</p>
    <h2>Using Kontact Touch</h2>
    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>On the left you find the navigation bar. Here you can tap on the folder names to navigate through your folders. The currently selected folder is bounded to the top and to the bottom from other folders.</p>
    <h3>Actions</h3>
    <p>Completely on the left you will usually find one or more so-called 'flaps'. Among them there usually is one labeled 'Actions'. You can pull out these flaps by swiping them from left to right. This prevents you from accidentally changing the folder even though you actually wanted to perform an action.</p>
    <p>The hereby opened action menu always offers you a range of actions that change depending on the view. In the action menu of the 'Home'-view you can do basic configurations, such as adding a new account. If you open the menu from a view that for example displays several mails, you will find options to work with these messages (such as moving, deleting, or replying to them).</p>
    <h3>Select individual objects</h3>
    <p>To select individual objects (e.g. an email) in order to read them, you simply tap on that object in the list. It will then open. In this view you can reach the non-visible parts of the object by swiping up or down. By swiping right or left, you will scroll through the list of objects - in other words the next or previous item of the list will get loaded. In addition, in the lower right corner of the object you will find one or more icons. One of them symbolizes a list and returns you from the object-view to the navigation mode.</p>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>First thing you should do is to set-up your existing e-mail and groupware accounts in the 'Actions' menu of the 'Home' view under 'accounts'. Please note that the first synchronization may take a very long time. After this had happened once, Kontact Touch should run smoothly.</p>
    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <h3>Select multiple folders</h3>
    <p>In the 'home' view you find in the bottom right a button labeled 'Select'. Tap it to have the option to select multiple folders and to show them in one view after tap 'done'. To select the folders you can navigate as usual through your folders on the left side and drag the desired folders to the right side.</p>
    <h3>Frequently needed views</h3>
    <p>Is there a view containing one or more folders that you need more often, you will find in the action menu the option 'Add as Favorite'. If you select this option, you can specify a name under which you can subsequently select it directly out of your 'Home' view. This way you can quickly change between all frequently needed views.</p>
    <h3>Editing multiple objects</h3>
    <p>If you want to perform the same action simultaneously with multiple objects in a view (e.g. move multiple messages to a particular folder), you can tap on the already selected folder again. The view then switches to the 'bulk edit' mode. If you then tap an object, it will only be selected. On the left side you now have several options to perform actions with the selected objects (e.g. moving). You can leave the 'bulk edit' mode by tapping the left-pointing arrow below the folder name.</p>
