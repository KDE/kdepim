    /** The following disposition-types are defined:

	@li Displayed    The message has been displayed by the UA to someone
                         reading the recipient's mailbox.  There is
			 no guarantee that the content has been
			 read or understood.

	@li Dispatched   The message has been sent somewhere in some manner
                         (e.g., printed, faxed, forwarded) without
			 necessarily having been previously
			 displayed to the user.  The user may or
			 may not see the message later.

        @li Processed    The message has been processed in some manner (i.e.,
                         by some sort of rules or server) without
			 being displayed to the user.  The user may
			 or may not see the message later, or there
			 may not even be a human user associated
			 with the mailbox.

        @li Deleted      The message has been deleted.  The recipient may or
                         may not have seen the message.  The
			 recipient might "undelete" the message at
			 a later time and read the message.

        @li Denied       The recipient does not wish the sender to be informed
                         of the message's disposition.  A UA may
			 also siliently ignore message disposition
			 requests in this situation.

        @li Failed       A failure occurred that prevented the proper
                         generation of an MDN.  More information
                         about the cause of the failure may be
                         contained in a Failure field.  The
                         "failed" disposition type is not to be
			 used for the situation in which there is
			 is some problem in processing the message
			 other than interpreting the request for an
			 MDN.  The "processed" or other disposition
			 type with appropriate disposition
			 modifiers is to be used in such
			 situations.

       IOW: @p Displayed when - well -displayed
            @p Dispatched when forwarding unseen ( == new )
	    @p Processed (maybe) when piping unseen, but probably never used
	    @p Deleted when deleting unseen
	    @p Denied on user command
	    @p Failed on Disposition-Notification-Options containing
               unknown required options. ( == @em any required options )
	       @p Failed needs a description in the @p special parameter.

			       automatically removed from the
