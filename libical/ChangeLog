	* icalrecur.c Fixed a bug in the increment_* routines that made
 	incrementing by more then 1 insensible. Thanks to Martin Neimeier

2000-11-20  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalmessage.c Many routines to create new ical messages. 

	* icalspanlist.c Code to generate a list of the busy time f the
 	VEVENTS in a set. Also includes routiens to generate free and busy
 	lists from the spanlist, and to find the next free time after a
 	given time.

	* icalvalue.c The STATUS property now has its own value type,
 	STATUS, which holds the enumeration icalproperty_status.

	* icalrestriction.c Added more restrictions. Now handles mutual
 	and exclusive consitions, and checks for the reight values in
 	STATUS properties
	

2000-11-10  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaltypes.c Added routine to create durationtype from string:
 	icaldurationtype_from_string

2000-11-09  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcomponet.c Add sever get/set convienience routines to access
 	and manipulate common component propoerties from the component
 	interface. This eliminates the need to create a lot of temporary
 	variables if you just want to change the start time of and event.

2000-11-06 Eric Busboom    <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcomponent.c Added new routines to icalcomponent:
	_get_span -- returns the start and end times of the event in UTC
	_get_first_real_component -- return ref to VTODO, VEVENT or VJOURNAL

	* icalspanlist.c Added new class, icalspanlist, that generates a
 	list of alternating busy and free times from an icalset. The class
 	includes routines to gnerate rfc2445 busy and free lists, and to
 	get the next avaliable busy or free time after a given time.

2000-11-06  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>
 
        * src/libical/icalvalue.c (icalvalue_recur_as_ical_string): Handle
        both the position and weekday in the by_day field.        

2000-10-20  Eric Busboom  <eric@agony.busboom.org>

	* Const correctness. Added 'const' all over everywhere. 

2000-10-19  Eric Busboom  <eric@agony.busboom.org>

	* icalproperty, icalparameter, icalvalue .c, .h Changed most
	instances of char* to const char*

	* icalclassify.h Added multiple include protection

	* icalset.h and others, got rid of parameter named "new"
	
2000-10-15 Eric Busboom   <eric@softwarestudio.org>
	
	* icalcomponent Added convienience functions for constructing
 	components: icalcomponent_new_vcalendar(), etc.

	* Makefile.am Incorporated build system patch from Federico
 	Quintero. Misc small fixes and cleanup

	* scripts Incorporated auto-gen patch from Frederico. Generated
 	code in libical now uses icalproperty.c.in (etc) instead of
 	editing file icalparoperty.c in place.

	* libical. Changed flex/bison to use the -P/-p options to set
 	ical_yy as a prefix. Removed prefix redefinition from icalyacc.y
	
2000-10-12 Eric Busboom    <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalproperty.c Fixed icalproperty_get_{first,next}_parameter to
 	honor the parameter kind argument

	* icalparameter.c Added, but did not complete, a new version of
 	icalparameters_from_string that does not use the hairy nested
 	case/switch statements of the previous version
	
	
2000-10-02 Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* ical.h ical.h and icalss.h now are concatenations of all of the
 	public headers for their respective libraries. Thus, only ical.h,
 	icalss.h and icalvcal.h need to be installed.

2000-09-11  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalvcal.c Added more comments 
	
2000-08-31  JP Rosevear  <jpr@helixcode.com>

	* configure.in: Don't list config.h in AC_OUTPUT
	
2000-08-26  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* examples/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): More `$(srcdir)' loving.

	* src/libicalvcal/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add `-I
	$(srcdir)/../libical' for builddir != srcdir loving.

2000-08-25  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* examples/access_properties_and_parameters.c,
	src/libicalvcal/vcc.y: Got rid of some warnings.

	* src/libicalvcal/vcc.c: Checking in generated C file.

2000-08-25  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalcomponent.c: Fixed an incorrect struct name.

2000-08-25  Peter Williams  <peterw@helixcode.com>

	* src/libical/icalcomponent.c (icalcomponent_end_component): Compile fix;
	use icalerror_check_arg_re so we can return an valid icalcompiter.
	(icalcomponent_begin_component): Same.

2000-08-24  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* src/test/Makefile.am: Make it work.
	
2000-08-04  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* stow.c Changed stow to write data to a file ( icalfileset) not a
 	calendar. Also added MIME parsing capability

	* sspm.c Core of the mime processor. Now handles quoted-printable
 	and base64 encodings

	* icalmime.h New file that parses mime data and returns an
 	icalcomponent that includes all of the parts.

	
2000-07-26   Eric Busboom   <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaldirset.h misc bug fixes to get deleting components to work

	* icalcomponent.h Eliminated internal use of _get_first_component
 	and _get_next_component, since these will reset the interal
 	iterators.

2000-07-23   Eric Busboom   <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcomponent.h Added external iterators to icalcomponent for
 	subcomponents: icalcompiter. These are still experimental, but they
 	seem to work OK and have a nice syntax

2000-07-18   Eric Busboom   <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalset This is a new "superclass" for icalstore, icalcluster,
 	and others. It merges the interfaces of the old icalstore and
 	icalcluster

	* icalstore.{c,h} CHanged name to icaldirset

	* icalcluster.{c,h} Changed name to icalfileset
	

2000-06-12  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalstow.c misc improvements and bug fixes to make it useful.

2000-06-09  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalrecur.c More extensive code changes for recurrence rule.

	* icalyacc.y Added support for integers in by day lists

2000-06-01  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalrecur.c moved recur code into new files

2000-05-30  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icaltypes.c Extensive work on code to expand recurences

	* icaltypes.h Changed signature icaltimetype_from_timet to include
 	is_utc flag.
	

2000-03-17  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalstore.c Vastly improved icalstore_test. 

2000-03-16  Eric Busboom  <eric@softwarestudio.org>

	* icalcluster.c Added compile flag (ICAL_SAFESAVES) to switch how
 	icalcluster saves files during commits. When the flag is define,
 	it will write the data to a temorar file and rename the file to
 	the target file.

	* storage.c Added seterate test suite for sotage components

	* icalparser.c Created parser object, implemented line-oriented
 	parsering, and made message oriented parsing work in terms f line
 	oriented parsing.

	* icalparser.c Fixed icalparser_get_line to remove \r in input.
