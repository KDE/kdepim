 Icalset is the "base class" for representations of a collection of
 iCal components. Derived classes (actually delegatees) include:
 
    icalfileset   Store componetns in a single file
    icaldirset    Store components in multiple files in a directory
    icalheapset   Store components on the heap
    icalmysqlset  Store components in a mysql database.
