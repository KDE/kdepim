These scripts are to be executed like this:
 Windows: gpg-connect-agent -v --no-ext-connect -S path\to\S.uiserver < script
 Unix:    gpg-connect-agent -v                  -S path/to/S.uiserver < script
For Windows, you need a very recent gpg-connect-agent for most scripts,
probably from current gnupg-SVN, though on Unix, the one from 2.0.0 works, too.
