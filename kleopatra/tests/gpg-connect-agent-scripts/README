These scripts are to be executed like this:
 Windows: gpg-connect-agent -v --no-ext-connect -S path\to\S.uiserver < script
 Unix:    gpg-connect-agent -v                  -S path/to/S.uiserver < script
You need a very recent gpg-connect-agent for most scripts, probably even the
patch gpg-connect-agent-subst-envvars.diff in this directory, at least for the
gpgex cases.

They assume the contents of ../gnupg_home, so you should point gpg(sm) there,
by setting GNUPGHOME to there.
