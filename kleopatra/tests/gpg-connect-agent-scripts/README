These scripts are to be executed like this:
 Windows: gpg-connect-agent -v --no-ext-connect -S path\to\S.uiserver < script
 Unix:    gpg-connect-agent -v                  -S path/to/S.uiserver < script
You need a very recent gpg-connect-agent (min. GnuPG 2.0.8-svn4603) for most
scripts, at least for the gpgex cases.

Scripts assume the contents of ../gnupg_home, so you should point gpg(sm) there,
by setting GNUPGHOME.
