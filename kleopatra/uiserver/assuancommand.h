      \brief Base class for GnuPG UI Server commands

      \note large parts of this are outdated by now!

      <h3>Implementing a new AssuanCommand</h3>

      You do not directly inherit AssuanCommand, unless you want to
      deal with implementing low-level, repetetive things like name()
      in terms of staticName(). Assuming you don't, then you inherit
      your command class from AssuanCommandMixin, passing your class
      as the template argument to AssuanCommandMixin, like this:

      \code
      class MyFooCommand : public AssuanCommandMixin<MyFooCommand> {
      \endcode
      (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern)

      You then choose a command name, and return that from the static
      method staticName(), which is by convention queried by both
      AssuanCommandMixin<> and GenericAssuanCommandFactory<>:

      \code
          static const char * staticName() { return "MYFOO"; }
      \endcode

      The string should be all-uppercase by convention, but the
      UiServer implementation doesn't enforce this.

      The next step is to implement start(), the starting point of
      command execution:

      <h3>Executing the command</h3>

      \code
          int start( const std::string & line ) {
      \endcode

      This should set everything up and check the parameters in \a
      line and any options this command understands. If there's an
      error, choose one of the gpg-error codes and create a
      gpg_error_t from it using the protected makeError() function:

      \code
              return makeError( GPG_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED );
      \endcode

      But usually, you will want to create a dialog, or call some
      GpgME function from here. In case of errors from GpgME, you
      shouldn't pipe them through makeError(), but return them
      as-is. This will preserve the error source. Error created using
      makeError() will have Kleopatra as their error source, so watch
      out what you're doing :)

      In addition to options and the command line, your command might
      require \em{bulk data} input or output. That's what the bulk
      input and output channels are for. You can check whether the
      client handed you an input channel by checking that
      bulkInputDevice() isn't NULL, likewise for bulkOutputDevice().

      If everything is ok, you return 0. This indicates to the client
      that the command has been accepted and is now in progress.

      In this mode (start() returned 0), there are a bunch of options
      for your command to do. Some commands may require additional
      information from the client. The options passed to start() are
      designed to be persistent across commands, and rather limited in
      length (there's a strict line length limit in the assuan
      protocol with no line continuation mechanism). The same is true
      for command line arguments, which, in addition, you have to
      parse yourself. Those usually apply only to this command, and
      not to following ones.

      If you need data that might be larger than the line length
      limit, you can either expect it on the bulkInputDevice(), or, if
      you have the need for more than one such data channel, or the
      data is optional or conditional on some condition that can only
      be determined during command execution, you can \em inquire the
      missing information from the client.

      As an example, a VERIFY command would expect the signed data on
      the bulkInputDevice(). But if the input stream doesn't contain
      an embedded (opaque) signature, indicating a \em detached
      signature, it would go and inquire that data from the
      client. Here's how it works:

      \code
      const int err = inquire( "DETACHED_SIGNATURE",
                               this, SLOT(slotDetachedSignature(int,QByteArray,QByteArray)) );
      if ( err )
          done( err );
      \endcode

      This should be self-explanatory: You give a slot to call when
      the data has arrived. The slot's first argument is an error
      code. The second the data (if any), and the third is just
      repeating what you gave as inquire()'s first argument. As usual,
      you can leave argument off of the end, if you are not interested
      in them.

      You can do as many inquiries as you want, but only one at a
      time.

      You should peridocally send status updates to the client. You do
      that by calling sendStatus().

      Once your command has finished executing, call done(). If it's
      with an error code, call done(err) like above. \bold{Do not
      forget to call done() when done!}. It will close
      bulkInputDevice(), bulkOutputDevice(), and send an OK or ERR
      message back to the client.

      At that point, your command has finished executing, and a new
      one can be accepted, or the connection closed.

      Apropos connection closed. The only way for the client to cancel
      an operation is to shut down the connection. In this case, the
      canceled() function will be called. At that point, the
      connection to the client will have been broken already, and all
      you can do is pack your things and go down gracefully.

      If _you_ detect that the user has canceled (your dialog contains
      a cancel button, doesn't it?), then you should instead call
      done( GPG_ERR_CANCELED ), like for normal operation.

      <h3>Registering the command with UiServer</h3>

      To register a command, you implement a AssuanCommandFactory for
      your AssuanCommand subclass, and register it with the
      UiServer. This can be made considerably easier using
      GenericAssuanCommandFactory:

      \code
      UiServer server;
      server.registerCommandFactory( shared_ptr<AssuanCommandFactory>( new GenericAssuanCommandFactory<MyFooCommand> ) );
      // more registerCommandFactory calls...
      server.start();
      \endcode
