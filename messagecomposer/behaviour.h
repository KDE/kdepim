  FIXME
  I can't figure out how else to make this work.  If I put it in the cpp or in another
  file like behaviour_p.h, I get 'incomplete type' errors.  If I put it in behavior_p.h
  and include it in the bottom, I need to install the _p anyway.
  The problem seems to be that Behaviour needs Behaviour::Private (for QSharedDataPointer),
  but Behaviour::Private needs Behaviour back (for Behaviour:LastAction).
  -> I removed the latter dependency and the problem persists :-/
