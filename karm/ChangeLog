--------
- "Reset Session Times" wouldn't get reset correctly.
  Thanks to dwayne for reporting and to Scott Monachello for
  the fix.                                              closes: #34343

KArm 1.1
--------
- clocks are stopped and times saved upon exit

KArm 0.6
--------
- It is now possible to type in the time like 3:20, or 3:20 + 1:10
- The two QListBoxes with time and description has been replaced with one
  QListView. This makes the interface nicer, and simplifies a lot internally.

--------
- Fixes edit task bugs
- Complies to new FSSTND


KArm 0.2
--------
- Now supports floating toolbar
- Documentation converted to linuxdoc
