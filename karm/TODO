* check: times can be negative - does that make any sense?
* add better screenshot to http://pim.kde.org/components/karm.php
* KarmWindow::makeMenus -> export KAction?
* KarmWindow::contextMenuRequest QPopupMenu should be static!
* put connect( ..contextMenu at the right place
* mainwindow: move tray signals into tray.cpp
* mainwindow.cpp: before loading view, check whether the file exists
  and if not, create a blank one and ask wheter we want to add a task.
  (hmmm, see my notes in iCalendar section below).
* add mouse double-click action (start new timer, stop old) to "Configure
  Shortcuts" dialog.
* deleting a task should be logged as well.
* log start/stop session

* Willi / desktop tracker:
--------------------------

  * Willi said he'd push:

    // If all available desktops are checked, disable auto tracking,
    // since it makes no sense to track for every desktop.
    if (dl.size() == (unsigned int)desktopCount)
      dl.clear();

    from TaskView::editTask into addtaskdialog.

  * The runtime warnings still need to be fixed.

  * the desktop tracker is not able to handle a changing number of
    desktops (i.e. if we add or remove a desktop)

Mark / iCalendar Work:
--------------------------

  * 2003-08-15: Update karmstorage.cpp when LocalCalendar::deleteTodo works.
      - KarmStorage::removeTask: delete "return false;" and uncomment code
    
  * 2003-08-15: Remove code that is causing compiler warnings.
  
  * 2003-08-15: Add ability to import tasks from an iCalendar file.
      - TaskView::load()
  
  * 2003-08-15: If Cornelius accepts my comment patch, use the COMMENT
    attribute to store comments, not the VTODO DESCRIPTION.
      - KarmStorage::addComment()

  * 2003-08-15: Go over code and delete all cruft.  In particular, take a look
    at taskview.cpp.

  * 2003-08-15: When loading an empty ics file, ask user if they want to
    import a task list from another file.  If they say no, then pop up the new
    task dialog.  (TaskView::load).

  * 2003-09-03: Timecard report.

  * 2003-09-03: Replace all string concatenations with .arg (for i18n).

  * 2003-09-03: Review all strings and attempt to minimize i18n work.

  * 2003-09-03: Use file menu and delete storeage page in preferences.


Wishlist:
---------
* activeTasks should be cleaned up
* if two timers are active, associate a percentage with them, optimaly the
  percentage should be configurable
* completed % per task
* don't display competed tasks
* context menu in headers for choosing if one wants to see some column or not
