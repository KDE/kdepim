* KarmWindow::makeMenus -> export KAction?
* KarmWindow::contextMenuRequest QPopupMenu should be static!
* put connect( ..contextMenu at the right place
* mainwindow: move tray signals into tray.cpp
* add mouse double-click action (start new timer, stop old) to "Configure
  Shortcuts" dialog.

Mark - Sooner ...
--------------------------

  * 2003-09-24: Generate man page (look for script mentioned on kde-devel).

  * 2004-01-27: BUG: if save fails (b/c of permission failure) KArm does not
    give any feecback and proceeds as if there was no error.

  * 2003-09-17: BUG: entering a negative time increments total session time
    (maybe only if session time is zero?)

Mark - Later ...
--------------------------

  * 2004-06-14: In file exports, check if QT has a function to give you a
    platform-specific end of line character.  Right now, it is hard coded to a
    "\n"

  * 2003-08-15: Implement comments: VTODO COMMENT or DESCRIPTION?
      - Make sure wrapping works according to iCalendar spec.
      - Handle multiple comments against same VEVENT.
      - Show in history report.

  * 2004-01-27: Write dcop interface so time cards can be exported to other
    systems.

  * 2003-09-24: Change menu entry from KArm to Time Clock.

  * 2003-08-15: Go over code and delete all cruft.  In particular, take a look
    at taskview.cpp.
  
  * 2003-09-26: Add totals table across entire date range.

  * 2003-09-19: If task active, editing task stops timer.  Necessary?

  * 2003-08-15: When loading an empty ics file, ask user if they want to
    import a task list from another file.  If they say no, then pop up the new
    task dialog.  (TaskView::load).

  * 2003-09-03: Use file menu and delete storeage page in preferences.

  * 2003-08-15: Add ability to import tasks from an iCalendar file.
      - TaskView::load()

  * 2003-09-26: On timecard report, don't print rows for tasks with zero hours
    unless a child task has hours logged (that is, show full tree for every
    task with time logged).

  * 2003-10-13: New event: publish time card.  Mark events that are published
    as read-only.  Create plug-in framework so that when this event occurs, we
    export to a different backend.  Write plugins for GnuCash and SQL-Ledger.
    Hmmm ... or just write a sql calendar resource?


Wishlist:
---------
* activeTasks should be cleaned up
* if two timers are active, associate a percentage with them, optimaly the
  percentage should be configurable
* completed % per task
* don't display competed tasks
* context menu in headers for choosing if one wants to see some column or not
