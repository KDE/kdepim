* check: times can be negative - does that make any sense?
* add better screenshot to http://pim.kde.org/components/karm.php
* KarmWindow::makeMenus -> export KAction?
* KarmWindow::contextMenuRequest QPopupMenu should be static!
* put connect( ..contextMenu at the right place
* mainwindow: move tray signals into tray.cpp
* mainwindow.cpp: before loading view, check whether the file exists
  and if not, create a blank one and ask wheter we want to add a task.
  (hmmm, see my notes in iCalendar section below).
* add mouse double-click action (start new timer, stop old) to "Configure
  Shortcuts" dialog.
* deleting a task should be logged as well.
* log start/stop session

* Willi / desktop tracker:
--------------------------

  * Willi said he'd push:

    // If all available desktops are checked, disable auto tracking,
    // since it makes no sense to track for every desktop.
    if (dl.size() == (unsigned int)desktopCount)
      dl.clear();

    from TaskView::editTask into addtaskdialog.

  * The runtime warnings still need to be fixed.

  * the desktop tracker is not able to handle a changing number of
    desktops (i.e. if we add or remove a desktop)

Mark - 3.2
--------------------------

  * 2003-09-17: BUG: entering a negative time increments total session time
    (maybe only if session time is zero?)

  * 2003-09-24: Add comments to report (or put it off to 3.3).  Need to stamp
    comments with datetime entered so the history report can associate
    comments with the proper week.  Note that the original code only allowed
    you to add comments to a task you were timing.

  * 2003-09-24: UPDATE DOCS!!

  * ONGOING: Update feature plan.

X * 2003-09-24: Add new task action--mark as complete.  Don't load completed
    tasks.

  * 2003-09-24: Change menu entry from KArm to Time Clock.

  * 2003-09-24: Generate man page (look for script mentioned on kde-devel).

  * 2003-09-23: Auto-save should write events.
  
X  * 2003-09-03: Replace all string concatenations with .arg (for i18n).
    
  * 2003-08-15: Remove code that is causing compiler warnings.

  * 2003-08-15: Go over code and delete all cruft.  In particular, take a look
    at taskview.cpp.
  
  * 2003-08-15: If Cornelius accepts my comment patch, use the COMMENT
    attribute to store comments, not the VTODO DESCRIPTION.
      - KarmStorage::addComment()

  * 2003-09-03: Review all strings and attempt to minimize i18n work.

  * 2003-09-17: Run through Valgrind.

  * 2003-08-15: Add ability to import tasks from an iCalendar file.
      - TaskView::load()

  * 2003-09-19: If task active, editing task stops timer.  Necessary?

Mark - 3.3
--------------------------

  * 2003-09-17: Modify KarmStorage to raise exceptions instead of returning
    empty string.  See DF's not in KarmStorage on the required mod to the
    Makefile.am.

  * 2003-08-15: When loading an empty ics file, ask user if they want to
    import a task list from another file.  If they say no, then pop up the new
    task dialog.  (TaskView::load).

  * 2003-09-03: Use file menu and delete storeage page in preferences.



Wishlist:
---------
* activeTasks should be cleaned up
* if two timers are active, associate a percentage with them, optimaly the
  percentage should be configurable
* completed % per task
* don't display competed tasks
* context menu in headers for choosing if one wants to see some column or not
