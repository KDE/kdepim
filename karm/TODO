* check: times can be negative - does that make any sense?
* add better screenshot to http://pim.kde.org/components/karm.php
* KarmWindow::makeMenus -> export KAction?
* KarmWindow::contextMenuRequest QPopupMenu should be static!
* put connect( ..contextMenu at the right place
* mainwindow: move tray signals into tray.cpp
* add mouse double-click action (start new timer, stop old) to "Configure
  Shortcuts" dialog.

Mark - 3.3
--------------------------

  * 2003-09-24: Change menu entry from KArm to Time Clock.

  * 2003-08-15: Remove code that is causing compiler warnings.

  * 2003-08-15: Go over code and delete all cruft.  In particular, take a look
    at taskview.cpp.
  
  * 2003-08-15: If Cornelius accepts my comment patch, use the COMMENT
    attribute to store comments, not the VTODO DESCRIPTION.
      - KarmStorage::addComment()

  * 2003-09-26: Add totals table across entire date range.

  * 2003-09-19: If task active, editing task stops timer.  Necessary?

  * 2003-09-17: Modify KarmStorage to raise exceptions instead of returning
    empty string.  See DF's note in KarmStorage on the required mod to the
    Makefile.am.

  * 2003-08-15: When loading an empty ics file, ask user if they want to
    import a task list from another file.  If they say no, then pop up the new
    task dialog.  (TaskView::load).

  * 2003-09-03: Use file menu and delete storeage page in preferences.

  * 2003-08-15: Add ability to import tasks from an iCalendar file.
      - TaskView::load()

  * 2003-09-26: On timecard report, don't print rows for tasks with zero hours
    unless a child task has hours logged (that is, show full tree for every
    task with time logged).

  * 2003-09-24: Add comments to report.
      1. Only activate menu choice when task(s) are active
      2. Append comment to VEVENTs description
      3. Make sure wrapping works according to iCalendar spec.
      4. Handle multiple comments against same VEVENT.
      5. Show in history report.

  * 2003-10-13: New event: publish time card.  Mark events that are published
    as read-only.  Create plug-in framework so that when this event occurs, we
    export to a different backend.  Write plugins for GnuCash and SQL-Ledger.


Wishlist:
---------
* activeTasks should be cleaned up
* if two timers are active, associate a percentage with them, optimaly the
  percentage should be configurable
* completed % per task
* don't display competed tasks
* context menu in headers for choosing if one wants to see some column or not
