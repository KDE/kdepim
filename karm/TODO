* times can be negative - does that make any sense?
* one can adjust subtask *and* task times which has the effect that times
  won't add up any more - does that make sense?
* add notes to logentries
* the BUGS file contains nonsense
* add better screenshot to http://pim.kde.org/components/karm.php
* KarmWindow::makeMenus -> export KAction?
* KarmWindow::contextMenuRequest QPopupMenu should be static!
* connect( ..contextMenu einordnen
* mainwindow: move tray signals into tray.cpp
* formatTime has nothing to do in TaskView?
* "#ifndef header"s are inconsistent
* mainwindow.cpp: before loading view, check whether the file exists
  and if not, create a blank one and ask wheter we want to add a task.
* add mouse double-click action (start new timer, stop old) to "Configure
  Shortcuts" dialog.
* Deleting a task should be logged as well.

* Willi:
--------
  * If one starts karm and installs some desktop tracking tasks nothing
    happens. One has to restart karm in order to have them work.

  * The tracker functionality should be split out into a separate file/class.
    mainwindow.cpp is IMHO long enough as is.

  * Willi said he'd push:

    // If all available desktops are checked, disable auto tracking,
    // since it makes no sense to track for every desktop.
    if (dl.size() == (unsigned int)desktopCount)
      dl.clear();

    from TaskView::editTask into addtaskdialog.

  * The runtime warnings still need to be fixed.

* app is crashing when leaving through the "x" on the upper right in the window.
