KArm is a time tracker for busy people who need to keep track of the amount
of time they spend on various tasks.

In KArm you can enter a list of "tasks", start KArm's clock, and it will
count the number of minutes you spend on the highlighted task.

In my day, I may have to work on several different projects and keep track
separately of how much time I spent working on each project. If you are
like me, then KArm is for you.

KArm was inspired by Harald Tveit Alvestrand's very useful utility called
titrax, the only failing of which is that it is based on the Xt toolkit. One
day KArm will do all that titrax does, but not today.

The word "karm", in my mother tongue Punjabi, means "work".
