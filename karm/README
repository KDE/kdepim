KArm tracks time spent on various tasks. It is useful for tracking hours to be
billed to different clients or just to find out what percentage of your day is
spent playing Doom or reading Slashdot.

KArm was originaly written by Sirtaj Singh Kang. The word "karm" means "work"
in the author's native Punjabi.
			    
KArm was inspired by Harald Tveit Alvestrand's very useful utility called
titrax, the only failing of which is that it is based on the Xt toolkit. One
day KArm will do all that titrax does, but not today.
