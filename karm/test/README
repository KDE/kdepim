runscripts.cpp

  Parses this directory for script files (Python, Perl and Bash).  It
  identifies a script file by the extension.
  
  To add a new test, save the script file here and then run "make check."
  
  It runs any script files it finds.  Within each script type, it runs the
  scripts in alphabetical order.

  If any script fails, then the program stops.

  Script files should return a non-zero exit code to indicate a failure.

  NOTE: runscripts does not kill scripts that never return.  You have to 
  press Control-C to terminate the "make check" command.
