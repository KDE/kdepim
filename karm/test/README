runscripts.cpp

  Parse directory for script files (Python and Bash).  Run them if found.
  Script files need to return a zero or 1 to indicate test result.

  So the idea is you can add a new test without having to edit any C code.
  
  iCalendar testing is a lot of string manipulation, so Python seems like
  a good fit.

  The Bash scripts will be, for example, Thorsten's xautomation testing.
