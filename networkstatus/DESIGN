The system consists of 3 classes of components:

1) Network service applications
  Responsible for reporting the status of the system's network connection(s).  May be a KDE app or
anything (including a system networking script) that can talk DBus.  These are responsible for registering networks with, and updating their status at

2) KDED Module - networkstatus
  Hub of the system.  Implements two DBus interfaces at /modules/networkstatus,
  org.kde.Solid.Networking.Service (for use by service applications, above) and
  org.kde.Solid.Networking.Client (for client apps, below) networkstatus knows of the status of any networks registered with it, which it aggregates and reports the most connected status onwards, to

3) Network client applications {
  Regular KDE applications which need to use the network.  These either listen directly to
org.kde.kded /modules/networkstatus' signals, or use the KConnectionManager object to react to
network status changes.

UI Components
The kconnectionmanager library also contains a widget, NetworkStatusConnectionIndicator, which is
intended for use in application toolbars.  This widget shows itself when the system is offline, and
hides itself when the system is connected.

KConnectionManager
As well as signalling status changes, KConnectionManager can easily call registered slots on
connected and disconnected events.  These are controlled by ConnectionPolicy, which describes the
circumstances when KConnectionManager should manage a connection.
