/**
* @brief Interface for output formatters
*
* This is the interface for output formatters.
* Output formats can used to write only parts of the an addressee object's
* data to the output stream or to format the data in a specific way.
*
* @note Implementations can call writeAddressee() from writeAddresseeList() if
* that works for their format restrictions.
* If writeAddressee() is called from an outside caller, it can safely assume
* that there is no relation between two calls, i.e. the two calls belong to
* different operations. So in case an implementation needs to write some
* header or footer it can do so in both writeAddressee() and
* writeAddresseeList().
