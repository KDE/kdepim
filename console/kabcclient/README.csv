The CSV input and output format filters are based on KAddressBook CSV templates.

The most convenient way to create such a template is using KAddressBook, but as
they are quite simple structured files they can be written manually as well.

A CSV template is basically an INI-style text file with the .desktop file
extension.

The file consists of three sections:

General: describes formatting options, like how dates should be interpreted
         or formatted, or what character is used as the field delimiter

Misc: Name of the template

csv column map: Describes which field or column of the CSV data has
                which addressbook field.

kabcclient finds template files in its current working directory and the
csv-template subdirectories of KAddressBook's data locations.

Available templates can be listed using help as the csv filters option

#> kabcclient -if csv -if-opts help
or
#> kabcclient -of csv -of-opts help

Using for example the kaddressbook template installed with KAddressBook
would look like this
#> kabcclient -if csv -if-opts kaddressbook
or
#> kabcclient -of csv -of-opts kaddressbook
        
Example:
--------- csvexample.desktop -------
[General]
Columns=3
DatePattern=Y-M-D
DelimiterType=0
QuoteType=0

[Misc]
Name=Example CSV template

[csv column map]
0=1
1=2
2=7
------------------------------------
This would transform the following input
"Doe","John","2005-07-25"
into an addressbook entry for a person names John Doe, having been born on
July 25th, 2005

Quotes can be omitted if the field's value does not contain the separator
character, e.g Doe,John,2005-07-25 would be a valid input as well
(no comma in any of the three fields)

Details:

Columns=3           says that the CSV data will have three fields.
DatePattern=Y-M-D   says that dates are to be interpreted as four digit year
                    followed by two digit month followed by a two digit day,
                    separated by '-'
                    Other possible letters are y (two digit year using 19 as
                    the century), m (one digit month for months < 10) and
                    d (one digit day for days < 10)
                    
DelimiterType=0     use comma as the field separator. Other possible values are:
                    1 (semicolon), 2 (tab), 3 (single space), 4 (user defined)
                    In case of DelimiterType=4 there is an additional entry
                    DelimiterOther which has the separator character as its
                    value.

                    DelimiterType=4 followed by DelimiterOther=, would for
                    example be equivalent to DelimiterType=0

QuoteType=0         use standard double quote character " as the possible field
                    quoting. Other possible values are: 1 (use single quote '),
                    2 no quoting.

                    The CSV output format filter uses the specified quote character
                    on all fields.

The column map tells the filters which columns of the CSV data maps to which
field in the address book. Column index starts at 0.
The above example template says that the first column is the family name, the
second column is the given name or first name and that the thrid and last columns
is the birthday date.
