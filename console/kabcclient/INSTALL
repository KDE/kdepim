Instructions on how to install kabcclient
=========================================

In case the configure script is missing in the source archive you
downloaded, you can create it using the following command inside
main directory of the unpacked source archive:

make -f Makefile.cvs

The configure command usually looks like this:
./configure --enable-final

(the --enable-final parameter speeds up compilation)

You can install into a different prefix (base directory) by using the
--prefix option, for example for installing into /usr/local

./configure --prefix=/usr/local

You don't have to install into one of KDE's directories because kabcclient doesn't
install KDE resources, but of course it doesn't hurt either.

CSV templates
=============

kabcclient can use KAddressBook's CSV templates as format descriptions for
its csv input and output format.

The name of the template to use is expected as the format's option, i.e.
as the parameter of the -if-opts or -of-opts commandline switch.

Templates are found in the current working directory and then in
KAddressBook's data directories.
Those are subdirectories named kaddressbook/csv-templates under any of the
paths you get with the following command:

kde-config --path data

For example /home/username/.kde/share/data/kaddressbook/csv-templates

See also the README.csv file

Bulding a Debian package
========================

It should be possible to build a Debian .deb package right from
the source archive.
Run the following command in the same directory this INSTALL file is in:

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

You will at least need the packages fakeroot and dpkg-dev for doing this.

WARNING: this is the first time I did this, so the resulting .deb
might not be fully correct.
If you respective fixes please send them my way!
