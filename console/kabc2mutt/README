KAbc2Mutt
-----------

kabc2mutt is a small programm to make the email addresses, stored in
kaddressbook, available in mutt.
You only have to add the following line to your .muttrc

    source "kabc2mutt |"

You can also configure mutt to query kabc2mutt when typing a substring
of an email address (see the docu for query_command).
To do this, add the following line to your .muttrc

    set query_command = "kabc2mutt --query '%s' --format query"

Have fun with it

Ciao,
