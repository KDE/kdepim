These are preliminary instructions on how to set up kdepim to work
with a kolab server. It is meant to be a help for people setting
up for testing. It is also meant as a list of things to set up in the
upcoming Kolab setup wizard.


There are the steps needed to setup the Kolab server as the primary
server.


KMail:

1. Set up your identity.
2. Set up a disconnected IMAP account to the server and sync it.
   Optional: Choose TLS and Clear text
3. Set up sending through the kolab server
   Optional: Choose authentication and/or TLS
4. After the first sync, enable IMAP resource folder options in
   Misc->Groupware and set to be subfolders of the account INBOX
5. Enable groupware functionality on the same page
6. TODO: Where is sieve setup???

Note: We might want to add a KMail profile for this in addition
to the kolab wizard.

KAddressBook:

1. Start KDE Control Center and go to KDE Components, page KDE
   Resources Configuration. Choose the contact resource. Add an
   IMAP resource and set it to standard.
   Optional: Delete others or set them to readonly.
2. Start KAddressBook and add an LDAP server in the configuration
   with these settings:
      Host = "kolab.kde.org" (for example)
      Port = "389"
      Base DN = "dc=kolab,dc=kde,dc=org"
   TODO: Are Bind DN and password the Kolab user settings?
   TODO: If yes, do they make the LDAP resource writable?
   The scheme for the base DN is to take the parts of the fully
   qualified hostname of the kolab server and put ",dc=" between
   the parts and "dc=" in front of it. Or in Qt code:
      baseDN = "dc=" + hostname.replace( '.', ",dc=" );
   Finally check the checkbox to activate the LDAP server. Now
   you can search the Kolab LDAP server and get all users on the
   system.


KOrganizer:

1. Start KDE Control Center and go to KDE Components, page KDE
   Resources Configuration. Choose the calendar resource. Add an
   IMAP resource and set it to standard.
   Optional: Delete others or set them to readonly.
TODO: Free-Busy setup and KMail mail scheduling.

General Notes:
==============
Autocompletion: Works in both KMail and KOrganizer. The order of resources used for completion
is as follows:
  1. All available addressbook resources as seen in "kcmshell kresources", section "kabc"
  2. LDAP

Nothing special, AFAIK
