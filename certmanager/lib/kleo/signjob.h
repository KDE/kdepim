     @short An abstract base class for asynchronous signing

     To use a SignJob, first obtain an instance from the CryptoBackend
     implementation, connect the progress() and result() signals to
     suitable slots and then start the signing with a call to
     start(). This call might fail, in which case the SignJob instance
     will have scheduled it's own destruction with a call to
     QObject::deleteLater().

     After result() is emitted, the SignJob will schedule it's own
     destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
