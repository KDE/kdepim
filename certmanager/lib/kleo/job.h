  /**
     @short An abstract base class for asynchronous crypto operations

     During the operation, you might receive progress updates through
     the progress() signal as they arrive, but an implementation is
     free to not send progress information. You should show a busy
     progressbar until the first progress() signal is received.

     The done() signal is emitted _before_ the result() signals of
     subclasses and should be used to hide and/or reset progress bars,
     not to learn of the end of the operation. Use the result()
     signals for that.

     To cancel the operation, simply call slotCancel(). The result()
     signal of subclasses will still be emitted, though, and will
     carry the information that the operation was canceled.
