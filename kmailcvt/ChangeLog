---- TODO

---- DONE

* 8-1-2000
  - Pegasus mail support added by Holger Schurig.

* dec. 2000
  - LDIF support added by Oliver Strutynski.

* 27-11-2000
  - Added Eudora Light Addressbook support. The addresses of this addressbook
    are put in the comment field of KAB, because in eudora there's no 
    difference between street, city, etc. 

* 25-11-2000
  - Patch from Laurent Montel added. We're working with a QGridLayout
    from now. Advantage: Infobox will automatically resize with window
    resizing. 

* 24-11-2000 
  - liboe.cxx changed. It didn't compile with RedHat 7. Don't know why.
    Removed fpos_t, changed it to int.

* 20-11-2000 
  - Patch from Daniel Andor added to dcopAddMessage() in the Kmail package.
    It now uses KFileToString() instead of a bunch of code that does the
    same thing.

---- Into KDENETWORK Package from now on.

* 0.50 -- 19-11-2000
  - Fixed a gcc 2.95 compiling problem. Removed all warnings generated by 
    the kmailcvt code.
  - Added dcop support (which is now default off). In the near future
    kmail will support kmailcvt in a dcop connection. This connection
    makes it possible to add emails to kmail without duplication.

* 0.42/0.24 -- 26-8-2000
  - Fixed a severe bug in version 0.23 (Called liboe with a non existing foldername)
  - Fixed a bug in liboe (0.23/0.41) - liboe tried to close a NULL file.

* 0.41/0.23 -- 24-8-2000
  - Added OE4 and OE5 support from Stephan Nedregard's liboe software.
    Many thanks to you Stephan! Disposed of my old OE5 code. This OE4
    and OE5 import code solves many problems.

* 0.40/0.22 -- 23-8-2000
  - Translation file for Dutch added. 
  - Documentation added:
      >> A document about the .PAB format (doc/en/PDF/PAB_Format.pdf)
      >> A document about adding filters to KmailCvt2 (doc/en/PDF/Adding_Filters.pdf)     

* 0.30 -- 3-8-2000
  - Added better recognition of MAPI record types.
  - Of now KmailCvt is a KDE2 application. 

* 0.22 -- 3-8-2000
  Bug fix for .PAB files --> Added support for PAB_FILE_ID recognition.
  Now the program complains, when the selected file is not a .PAB file.

* 0.2 -- 27-7-2000
  Added better support for .PAB MS Exchange Personal Addressbook format.
  Now it recognizes most(?) right MAPI types. The types (undocumented) are
  extracted from mapitags.h (Visual C++ header file) and some types were
  just found in a wierd HP Openmail .PAB file.

  Also, made a difference between addressbook containers and distribution lists
  at the top level.

* 0.1 Initial version for KDE 1.1.2.
  Support for Outlook Express 5.0
  Broken support for .PAB MS Exchange Personal Addressbook format.
