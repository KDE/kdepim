Kandy provides access to your mobile phone.

At the moment Kandy is more or less a terminal program with some special
features to store commands and their parameters, but is also has a simple GUI to
access the phone-book of a mobile phone and it is able to sync this phonebook
with the KDE address book.

Kandy is aimed at mobile phones with integrated (GSM) modems.
