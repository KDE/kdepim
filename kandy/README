Kandy 0.2
---------

Kandy provides access to your mobile phone and allows to sync the data on the
phone with the data on your desktop computer.

At the moment Kandy is more or less a terminal program with some special
features to store commands and their parameters, but is also has a simple GUI to
access the phone-book of a mobile phone and it is able to sync this phonebook
with the KDE address book.

Kandy is aimed at mobile phones with integrated (GSM) modems.
