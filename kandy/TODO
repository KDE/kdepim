+ Serial Device configuration dialog: Setting of Baud rate must be supported
  within the Kandy configuration.
+ There seem to exist mobile phones where a selected phone book does not start
  with index number 1. Still, this is assumed by Kandy and may lead to problems
  (Ericsson, Nokia?).
+ Support of phone book memory of the phone itself instead of only the SIM
  memory.
+ Adding a new tab to the MobileGUI supporting a mobile phone's records for
  last dialled numbers, own numbers, missed calls, ...
+ Adding a new tab to the MobileGUI supporting short message services
  (read, write, edit, send, sync with knotes, ...)
+ What about organizer features of a mobile phone (my Siemens supports a simple
  calendar and a full address book. HotSync with korganizer and KAB?).
+ The old Terminal Window of Kandy basically serves only for debugging
  purposes. The modem traffic is already mirrored in the "Terminal" tab of
  the mobile GUI. Hence, the terminal window can be fully removed from Kandy
  in the near future.
+ Somehow, a common kandy icon doesn't exist. Would be nice to have one...
