KPilot news. This file lists only major releases &c.
For more detailed information and musings, see the
ChangeLog or the README files. There is also the
history page on www.kpilot.org.

* November 18, 2006: KDE 3.5.5 is getting KPilot backported
  to it, and KPilot itself now uses CMake as its buildsystem.
* November 4, 2004: KDE 3.3.1 contains KPilot 4.4.5; there is
  a 4.4.6 available from the website, but it is of dubious
  quality.
* January 18, 2004: KDE 3.2 released, with KPilot 4.4.0. I'd
  say 4.4.0 is dead in the water, there's too much new useful
  stuff in 4.4.1 (for the PIM release).
* August 19, 2002: License change for the lib part of KPilot to
  LGPL and an exception made in the COPYING file for libmal to
  allow the AvantGo (tm) conduit to use that library.
* May 23, 2002: KPilot 4.3.2 seems ok now. It's too late for
  KDE 3.0.1. It should still work for KDE 2.2.2.
* January 20, 2002: KPilot 4.3.0b still isn't ready for release.
* April 8, 2001: KPilot 4.2.2 released with KDE 2.2a1.
* February 12, 2001: KPilot 4.0.0 released with KDE 2.1.
* 2000: KPilot 3.2.1 released. This is the last KDE 1.x release.
