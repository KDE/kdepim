/** \mainpage %KPilot API Overview

\section Architecture

%KPilot consists of a core library of utility and communications
classes which are used by two applications: KPilot itself
(which is little more than a clumsy data viewer and 
configuration shell) and the KPilot daemon which does
the actual communications with the hadheld.
The daemon loads plugins (called conduits) on demand
which are used for syncing specific data on the PC
with the handheld.
