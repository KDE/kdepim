KPILOT 4.2.1 by Dan Pilone
===========================
	Additional work by Robert Ambrose, 
	Preston Brown, Adriaan de Groot, 
	Heiko Purnhagen, Jorg Habenicht,
	and probably many more.

	KPilot is software for syncing the 3Com Palm Pilot, Palm III, IIIe,
IIIc, IIIx, V, Vx, M100, Handspring Visor and IBM Workpad with a machine 
running some flavor of unix. The actual PC->PP communcations was originally 
based on pilot-link.0.8.7, though you should use pilot-link.0.9.3 now. 
By default KPilot attempts to connnect using /dev/pilot which should be 
a link to the actual serial port, however this is configurable in the 
settings dialog. 

	This is the second release of KPilot 4.x, the first version of
KPilot that works with and under KDE2. It is released as part of KDE 2.2.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

	The file ../README contains minimal information on how to compile
and install KPilot. Since KPilot is part of the kdepim package, you
should also have the INSTALL file for kdepim, probably in ../../INSTALL.

	This README file only contains the release notes for KPilot 4.2.1.

UPGRADING FROM OLDER KPILOTS
============================

The first time you run KPilot 4.2.1, it will automatically display
the setup screen and you can check all the configuration settings.
If you used KPilot 3.x, you should also immediately configure all your
conduits (again) because many things have changed there.

CURRENT FEATURES
================
	* Conduit for abbrowser (experimental).
	* Conduit for expenses (experimental).
	* Improved international-character support.
	o Conduit for KNotes (still experimental).
	o Now a KDE2 application.
	o Plug in conduit support, currently including
		KOrganizer, todolist, null and PopMail
	o Hot-Sync daemon.  - Now hot-sync with just the push of the
	  Hot-Sync button on your cradle.  No need to launch KPilot.
	o Add/Delete/Edit memos.
	o Add/Delete/Edit addresses.
	o Full Category support for both memos and addresses.
	o KPilot now respects secret data.
	o More configuration options including port speed and 
	  docking control.
	o Now supports signature files for email.
	o Drag and drop to docked icon for file install.
	o International Support
	o Full Backup/Restore capabilities of Palm Pilot
	o File (prc,pdb) installation
	o Email syncing capabilities (via POP3 & sendmail)
	o SmartSync backing up modified data even
		for databases KPilot doesn't recognize
	o Import/Export to/from virtually any text format for
		Addresses.
	o Import/Export to/from text files for memos

	http://bugs.kde.org/db/pa/lkpilot.html

Please check with that database before reporting bugs.




STANDARD DISCLAIMER, WARNINGS, ETC..
====================================
	THIS SOFTWARE HAS BUGS.  Use at your own risk.  It has not even
been tested anywhere but on my machine and only with my Palm Pilot.  I
have been using it against XCopilot for development then verifying it
works with a real pilot with my Palm Pilot Professional running OS v2.0.4.  
It works with Adriaan's Palm V running PalmOS 3.5 as well.
I make no claims that it will work, or even try to work.  I take no
responsibility for any data loss, damage, etc. done by this software.  
ie:  Should your pilot burst into flames while trying to sync a new game..
sorry.
	That being said, I _really_ want comments regarding the software
as well as suggestions.  Bug fixes are even snazzier and code
contributions are welcome.  :)
