KPILOT 4.0.0 by Dan Pilone
===========================
	Additional work by Robert Ambrose, 
	Preston Brown, Adriaan de Groot, 
	Heiko Purnhagen, Jorg Habenicht,
	and probably many more.

	KPilot is software for syncing the 3Com Palm Pilot and IBM Workpad
(UNTESTED!) with a machine running some flavor of unix. The actual PC->PP
communcations was originally based on pilot-link.0.8.7. By default it
attempts to connnect using /dev/pilot which should be a link to the actual
serial port, however this is configurable in the settings dialog. 

[ The actual release announcement goes here ]

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

The files ../README and ../INSTALL contain information on how to compile
and install KPilot. This README file only contains the release announcement
for KPilot 4.0.0.

UPGRADING FROM OLDER KPILOTS
============================

The first time you run KPilot 4.0.0, it will automatically display
the setup screen and you can check all the configuration settings.
If you used KPilot 3.x, you should also immediately configure all your
conduits (again) because many things have changed there.

	o Now a KDE2 application.
	o Plug in conduit support, currently including
		KOrganizer, todolist, null and PopMail
	o Hot-Sync daemon.  - Now hot-sync with just the push of the
	  Hot-Sync button on your cradle.  No need to launch KPilot.
	o Add/Delete/Edit memos.
	o Add/Delete/Edit addresses.
	o Full Category support for both memos and addresses.
	o KPilot now respects secret data.
	o More configuration options including port speed and 
	  docking control.

STANDARD DISCLAIMER, WARNINGS, ETC..
====================================
	THIS SOFTWARE HAS BUGS.  Use at your own risk.  It has not even
been tested anywhere but on my machine and only with my Palm Pilot.  I
have been using it against XCopilot for development then verifying it
works with a real pilot with my Palm Pilot Professional running OS v2.0.4.  
It works with Adriaan's Palm V running PalmOS 3.5 as well.
I make no claims that it will work, or even try to work.  I take no
responsibility for any data loss, damage, etc. done by this software.  
ie:  Should your pilot burst into flames while trying to sync a new game..
sorry.
	That being said, I _really_ want comments regarding the software
as well as suggestions.  Bug fixes are even snazzier and code
contributions are welcome.  :)
