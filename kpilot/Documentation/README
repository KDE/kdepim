kpilot/Documentation
====================

This directory contains information pertinent to the design of
KPilot -- which is therefore only really interesting for 
developers of KPilot conduits, maintainers, etc.

Files in this directory are:

README			- This file
README-3.2.1+		- The README for KPilot 3.2.1 with some changes
			  that refer to KPilot 4 and KDE2, so it's quite
			  confusing.
README-4.0.0		- The real README for KPilot 4.0.0
HOWTO-CONDUIT.txt	- An introduction to writing conduits, last
			  updated for KPilot 3.1b9 (which is a LONG
			  time ago)
