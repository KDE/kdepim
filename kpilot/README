KPILOT 4.9.1 by Adriaan de Groot
=============================================
	Additional work by Robert Ambrose,
	Preston Brown, Adriaan de Groot,
	Heiko Purnhagen, Joerg Habenicht,

	Reinhold Kainhofer, Joern Ahrens,
	Jason Kasper,

	KPilot is software for syncing PalmOS based handhelds
such as the 3Com Palm Pilot with a machine running some flavor of UNIX.  

	Developer's notes are listed in the file ChangeLog. This is
probably only of interest if you want to see how certain features developed
or if certain bugs have been reported before.

STANDARD DISCLAIMER, WARNINGS, ETC..
====================================
	THIS SOFTWARE HAS BUGS.  Use at your own risk.  It has not even
been tested anywhere but on my machine and only with my Palm Pilot.  I
have been using it against XCopilot for development then verifying it
works with a real Pilot with my Palm Pilot Professional running OS v2.0.4.
I make no claims that it will work, or even try to work.  I take no
responsibility for any data loss, damage, etc. done by this software.
ie:  Should your Pilot burst into flames while trying to sync a new game..
sorry.
	That being said, I _really_ want comments regarding the software
as well as suggestions.  Bug fixes are even snazzier and code
contributions are welcome.  :)  Send mail to kde-pim@kde.org .
