KPILOT 4.4.1 by Dan Pilone / Adriaan de Groot
================================================
	Additional work by Robert Ambrose,
	Preston Brown, Adriaan de Groot,
	Heiko Purnhagen, Jorg Habenicht,
	David Bishop, Aaron Seigo,
	Reinhold Kainhofer
	and probably many more.

	KPilot is software for syncing the 3Com Palm Pilot and IBM Workpad
(UNTESTED!) with a machine running some flavor of unix.  By default KPilot
attempts to connnect using /dev/pilot which should be a link to the actual
serial port, however this is configurable in the settings dialog.

	Release notes can be found in Documentation/README-4.*. These are
official announcements of KPilot 4.x releases. There is also a README for
3.2.1 which is probably not interesting any more.

	Developer's notes are listed in the file ChangeLog. This is
probably only of interest if you want to see how certain features developed
or if certain bugs have been reported before.

	Generic installation instructions can be found in the file
INSTALL, but note that KPilot is part of the kdepim package and you
have to configure that package, not KPilot. KPilot does compile and
install on its own though, once kdepim is configured.

	You NEED pilot-link to compile or install KPilot; KPilot is
currently tested using version 0.10.1 of pilot-link.






STANDARD DISCLAIMER, WARNINGS, ETC..
====================================
	THIS SOFTWARE HAS BUGS.  Use at your own risk.  It has not even
been tested anywhere but on my machine and only with my Palm Pilot.  I
have been using it against XCopilot for development then verifying it
works with a real Pilot with my Palm Pilot Professional running OS v2.0.4.
I make no claims that it will work, or even try to work.  I take no
responsibility for any data loss, damage, etc. done by this software.
ie:  Should your Pilot burst into flames while trying to sync a new game..
sorry.
	That being said, I _really_ want comments regarding the software
as well as suggestions.  Bug fixes are even snazzier and code
contributions are welcome.  :)  Send mail to kde-pim@kde.org .
