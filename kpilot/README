	KPilot is software for syncing the 3Com Palm Pilot and IBM
Workpad (UNTESTED!) with a machine running some flavor of unix. The
actual PC->PP communcations was originally based on pilot-link.0.8.7.
By default it attempts to connnect using /dev/pilot which should be a
link to the actual serial port, however this is configurable in the
settings dialog. 

	This is the fouth release of KPilot.  The major change in this 
release is conduit support.  There are currently two included
conduits, a KOrganizer conduit (vcal syncing) and a PopMail conduit
(this fixes the email bug with KPilot 2.1).  Also fixed in this
release is the Address/Memo "off by one" bug.  This release _REQUIRES_ 
KDE Beta 4 or better.  Please see:
http://www.slac.com/pilone/kpilot_home/moreinfo.html 
for more information on the conduits and requirements.

Current features include:
		* Plug in conduit support, currently including
			KOrganizer and PopMail
		* Beta 4 compliant
	        o Hot-Sync daemon.  - Now hot-sync with just the push of the
          	  Hot-Sync button on your cradle.  No need to launch KPilot.
	        o Add/Delete/Edit memos.
                o Add/Delete/Edit addresses.
                o Full Category support for both memos and addresses.
                o KPilot now respects secret data.
                o More configuration options including port speed and docking control.
                o Now supports signature files for email.
                o Drag and drop to docked icon for file install.
                o International Support
		o Full Backup/Restore capabilities of Palm Pilot
		o File (prc,pdb) installation
		o Email syncing capabilities (via POP3 & sendmail)
	        o SmartSync backing up modified data even
			for databases KPilot doesn't recognize
	        o Import/Export to/from virtually any text format for
			Addresses.
	        o Import/Export to/from text files for memos
			
		(* = new in v3.0)

Installation
============

	KPilot _REQUIRES_ at least Beta 4 of KDE (http://www.kde.org/)
and v1.33 or better of the QT widget set (http://www.troll.no/).

	If you have these packages, a simple:

	./configure
	make
	make install

	from the kpilot-3.0 directory should configure and install
KPilot.  If you are using KPanel (the panel that comes with KDE)
restarting it should insert an icon into the Utilities submenu.  If
you are not using KPanel, the executable is named kpilot and will be
installed in either /opt/kde/bin/ or /usr/local/kde/bin (whichever is
appropriate for your system).

Using the software
==================

	When KPilot is run for the first time it will display the
settings dialog.  The default device is /dev/pilot (which should be a
link to the proper device for the pilot) though this is configurable.
Please verify this is correct.  Other settings can be configured at
this time but are not mandatory (though HIGHLY recommended).  The one
setting that you might want to take notice
of is "Local overrides pilot".  Setting this to true means that if
both the local record and the pilot record are modified, during the
next hot sync the local record will be considered the valid one and
both will be set to that. By default the Pilot is considered to be the
valid record and if both the local record and the pilot record have
been modified the local is overwritten by the pilot copy.  Hitting
"OK" will continue to the main KPilot screen.
	It is recommended you preform a full backup of your Pilot at
this point so that all of the data visible in KPilot is accurate and
any importing or exporting is properly merged the next time you
hot-sync.  You can do a full backup of your Pilot by selecting Backup
from the File Menu.
	The memo viewer allows you to view the memos on your pilot,
export them to text files, or import new ones to be installed the next 
time you hot-sync.  KPilot does not let you edit memos at this point.
(However you may export them, edit, and reimport, though you will end
up with two copies: the original, and the modified).
	The address viewer likewise lets you view, import and export
addressed to and from the Pilot.  The import and export format is
configurable via the settings dialog.  Note that the first field in the
import format is used as the key field.  That is, if Use Key Field is
turned on in the settings dialog, when importing if KPilot sees
another record with a matching "Key Field" the existing record is
updated to reflect the new data being read in.  If no such record
exists, a new record is created.  The default is not to use the key
field, so every record read in from the import file is created and
added to the database.
	To use the file installer supports dragging and dropping of
files into the file list area if you are using KFM, or just hit the
Add File button to add a file.  These files will be installed on your
Palm Pilot during the next hot sync if Sync Files is checked in the
settings dialog.

Standard Disclaimer, warnings, etc..
====================================

	THIS SOFTWARE HAS BUGS.  Use at your own risk.  It has not
even been tested anywhere but on my machine and only with my Palm
Pilot.  I have been using it against XCopilot for development then
verifying it works with a real pilot with my Palm Pilot Professional
running OS v2.0.4.  I make no claims that it will work, or even try to 
work.  I take no responsibility for any data loss, damage, etc. done
by this software.  ie:  Should your pilot burst into flames while
trying to sync a new game.. sorry.
	That being said, I _really_ want comments regarding the
software as well as suggestions.  Bug fixes are even snazzier and code 
contributions are welcome.  :)  This is being released so that it gets 
some exposure to influences other than mine and so that I can be sure
that it at least has a hope of running on something other than just my
machine.
