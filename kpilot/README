KPILOT 4.0.0 by Dan Pilone
===========================
	Additional work by Robert Ambrose, 
	Preston Brown, Adriaan de Groot, 
	Heiko Purnhagen, Jorg Habenicht,
	and probably many more.

	KPilot is software for syncing the 3Com Palm Pilot and IBM Workpad
(UNTESTED!) with a machine running some flavor of unix. The actual PC->PP
communcations was originally based on pilot-link.0.8.7. By default it
attempts to connnect using /dev/pilot which should be a link to the actual
serial port, however this is configurable in the settings dialog. 

	Release notes can be found in Documentation/README-4.*. These are
official announcements of KPilot 4.x releases. There is also a README for
3.2.1 which is probably not interesting any more.

	Additional release notes can be found in the user documentation.
The user documentation can be found under kpilot/doc. The user documentation
was last updated for KPilot 3.2.1, which was the last KDE 1 release of
KPilot. This means that the user documentation is quite out-of-date.

	Developer's notes are listed in the file ChangeLog. This is
probably only of interest if you want to see how certain features developed
or if certain bugs have been reported before.

	Generic installation instructions can be found in the file
INSTALL, but note that KPilot is part of the kdepim package and you 
have to configure that package, not KPilot. KPilot does compile and
install on its own though, once kdepim is configured.



USING THE SOFTWARE
==================
	When KPilot is run for the first time it will display the settings
dialog.  The default device is /dev/pilot (which should be a link to the
proper device for the pilot) though this is configurable. Please verify
this is correct.  
	IMPORTANT NOTE: the KPilot installation DOES NOT setup the serial
link; your OS installation may also require special handling. See the
section "Troubleshooting," below.
	Other settings can be configured at this time but are
not mandatory (though HIGHLY recommended).  The one setting that you might
want to take notice of is "Local overrides pilot".  Setting this to true
means that if both the local record and the pilot record are modified,
during the next hot sync the local record will be considered the valid one
and both will be set to that. By default the Pilot is considered to be the
valid record and if both the local record and the pilot record have been
modified the local is overwritten by the pilot copy.  
	Hitting "OK" will continue to the main KPilot screen.
	It is recommended you preform a full backup of your Pilot at this
point so that all of the data visible in KPilot is accurate and any
importing or exporting is properly merged the next time you hot-sync.  
You can do a full backup of your Pilot by selecting Backup from the File
Menu.

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
	The default serial device (/dev/pilot) does not exist on
most systems. Be SURE to either (a) use the actual serial port the Pilot
is attached to (i.e. /dev/ttyS0 for the device DOS calls COM1:) OR (b) set
up the link to the actual serial port by running (as root) "ln -s
/dev/ttySx /dev/pilot", where x is the number of the serial port. Note
that some older Linux setups use /dev/cuax instead of /dev/ttySx.
	If you're running Mandrake 7 and having trouble getting the
daemon to start or KPilot can't connect to the daemon, check the system
security setting. Sometimes local processes can't connect to *any*
local ports.
	More information is available in the user documentation.




STANDARD DISCLAIMER, WARNINGS, ETC..
====================================
	THIS SOFTWARE HAS BUGS.  Use at your own risk.  It has not even
been tested anywhere but on my machine and only with my Palm Pilot.  I
have been using it against XCopilot for development then verifying it
works with a real pilot with my Palm Pilot Professional running OS v2.0.4.  
I make no claims that it will work, or even try to work.  I take no
responsibility for any data loss, damage, etc. done by this software.  
ie:  Should your pilot burst into flames while trying to sync a new game..
sorry.
	That being said, I _really_ want comments regarding the software
as well as suggestions.  Bug fixes are even snazzier and code
contributions are welcome.  :)
