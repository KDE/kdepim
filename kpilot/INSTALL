Basic Installation
==================


KPilot uses the CMake build system which is the native build system
for KDE4; for KDE3 applications like KPilot, CMake is also useable.
You need CMake installed on your system to compile KPilot, but CMake
is becoming more widespread now. You can get it from www.cmake.org .

First configure KPilot by running

	./configure [options]

If you run configure with no options it will tell you which ones
are available; you *must* provide at least one for configure to
work. A most-vanilla configure looks like this:

	./configure --enable-tests=no

Suggested options are at least:

	./configure --enable-debug=yes --enable-tests=yes

You may need to specify a prefix or a location where pilot-link
is installed; run ./configure --show for a summary of options.

Once configure is done, compile KPilot, by running

	make -f Makefile.cmake

in the KPilot source directory (that is the one containing this
INSTALL file). This will run CMake to generate the real Makefiles,
then run make again to build the project in a build-* subdirectory.
Once it is done, you can run

	make -f Makefile.cmake install

to install KPilot in the KDE directory.




Advanced Installation
=====================

In order to build KPilot somewhere else, or if the sources are on
read-only media, use CMake directly instead of using the basic
Makefile included with KPilot. To do this,
	1) Create a build directory somewhere
	2) cd into that build directory
	3) Run cmake /path/to/kpilot/sources
	4) Run make

In order to install KPilot somewhere else, use -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX .
