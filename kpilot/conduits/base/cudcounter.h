/**
* Create-Update-Delete tracking of the plugin,
* used for reporting purposes (in a consistent manner).  The intent
* is that this class is used by the conduit as it is syncing data.
* For this to be useful (and be used properly), the conduit needs
* to tell us how many creates, updates, and deletes it has made to
* a data store (PC or HH).  It also needs to tell us how many
* records it started with and how many records it has at the
* conclusion of its processing.  Using this information, we can
* report on it consistently as well as analyze the activity taken
* by the conduit and offer rollback functionality if we think the
* conduit has behaved improperly.
