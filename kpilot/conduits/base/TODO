CATEGORYSYNCING:
* The conduit should make shure that the local backup database has exactly the
  same category information as the handhelds database.

	* We should introduce a Category object with: QString name, int index, char ID
		hhdataproxy should have a QList<Category>.

	* hhDataProxy::saveCategories() needs to pull all of the category info from 
		all of the records and write the PilotAppInfo out to fDatabase.

	* RecordConduit::updateBackupDatabase() needs to copy the categories from
		fDatabase into fLocalDatabase
		
	* HHDataProxy::loadCategories() needs to keep (at least) 2 lists of a new
		object that doesn't exist (CategoryInfo or something which has int index,
		QString name, and unsigned char ID)... one which gets saved off from
		loadCategories()
		
	* also, I think we need a hook in HHDataProxy whenever a HHRecord is added to
		it that does something with keeping the category on the HHRecord and the
		categories list in sync, keeping track of renamed categories, added
		categories, etc.
