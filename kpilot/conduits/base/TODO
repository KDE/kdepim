CATEGORYSYNCING:
* The conduit should make shure that the local backup database has exactly the
  same category information as the handhelds database.

	F We should introduce a Category object with: QString name, int index, char ID
		hhdataproxy should have a QList<Category>.

	* hhDataProxy::saveCategories() needs to pull all of the category info from 
		all of the records and write the PilotAppInfo out to fDatabase.

	* RecordConduit::updateBackupDatabase() needs to copy the categories from
		fDatabase into fLocalDatabase
		
	* HHDataProxy::loadCategories() needs to keep (at least) 2 lists of a new
		object that doesn't exist (CategoryInfo or something which has int index,
		QString name, and unsigned char ID)... one which gets saved off from
		loadCategories()
		
	* also, I think we need a hook in HHDataProxy whenever a HHRecord is added to
		it that does something with keeping the category on the HHRecord and the
		categories list in sync, keeping track of renamed categories, added
		categories, etc.

TESTCASES:
	* The first test case would be open a pc data store and a palm data
		store... add a record to the pc data store that has a new category that
		doesn't exist in the palm data store, then sync the two data stores. the
		outcome should be that the categories on the palm now contains the category
		that was associated with the record on the pc, and that the palm record is
		assigned to
