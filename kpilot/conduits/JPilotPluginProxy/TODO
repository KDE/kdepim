Things to be done for the JPilotPluginProxy conduit (in order of importance):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-) Make the jp_* functions available so that loading a plugin no longer crashes
-) enable adding a plugin path and automatically loading all plugins there (connot be done as long as loading most plugins crashes KPilot)
-) Make sure it sync correctly
-) Write out the log messages from the JPilot plugins to the log window in KPilot (emit logMessage, maybe have to connect a signal, or just reimplement jpilot_printf?)
-) Write a QGtkDialog which embeds the GtkWidget for the plugin settings. AFAIK this needs the message loop for the modal dialogbox to be rewritten
-) Lots of other things
