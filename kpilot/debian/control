Description: Palm Pilot sync software.
 Software for syncing the 3Com Palm Pilot and IBM
 Workpad (UNTESTED!) with a machine running some flavor of unix. The
 actual PC->PP communcations was originally based on pilot-link.0.8.7.
 By default it attempts to connnect using /dev/pilot which should be a
 link to the actual serial port, however this is configurable in the
 settings dialog.
 .
 This is the fouth release of KPilot.  The major change in this
 release is conduit support.  There are currently two included
 conduits, a KOrganizer conduit (vcal syncing) and a PopMail conduit
 (this fixes the email bug with KPilot 2.1).  Also fixed in this
 release is the Address/Memo "off by one" bug.  This release _REQUIRES_
 KDE Beta 4 or better.  Please see:

 for more information on the conduits and requirements.
