This file describes issues that need to be resolved with the KDE 2.0
port of KPilot:

_ FileInstallerWidget is totally hosed
x Docking (Dan - 7/26/00)
_ Drag and drop all over the place
_ VERION constant was removed from text strings.  I hate to do this,
  but I didn't feel like tracking the problem down...
_ pilotDaemon.cc drag and drop issues
x pilotDaemon.cc docking issues (Dan - 7/26/00)
_ pilotDaemon.cc KFM issues
x Add pilotInstalls, pilotdbs, and conduits to resource dirs (Dan - 7/26/00 removed)
_ Should port the popmail conduit to use the kio slave...
_ Should port popmail-conduit/passworddialg.cc to kde password thingee
_ Should clean up popmail-conduit to use long version of qt includes
