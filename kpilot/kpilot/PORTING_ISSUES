This file describes issues that need to be resolved with the KDE 2.0
port of KPilot:

_ FileInstallerWidget is totally hosed
_ Docking
_ Drag and drop all over the place
_ VERION constant was removed from text strings.  I hate to do this,
  but I didn't feel like tracking the problem down...
_ pilotDaemon.cc drag and drop issues
_ pilotDaemon.cc docking issues
_ pilotDaemon.cc KFM issues
_ Add pilotInstalls, pilotdbs, and conduits to resource dirs
