/**
* This used to be called SyncStack, and while a stack is cool
* for some things, it actually rather confuses the issue because
* you _use_ this class for specifying "do this, then that, then ..."
* and in program code you need to reverse that order when adding
* items to a stack. So now it's a Queue, FIFO, and program
* code looks more normal.
*
* Also updated to Qt3 in all aspects.
*/

/**
* The ActionQueue is a meta-action, which handles running a bunch of SyncActions
* in sequence. It is a SyncAction itself, so it can even be queued on another
* ActionQueue.
*
* An ActionQueue is constructed with a @p device. As usual, you should connect
* the device's deviceReady() signal with the exec() slot -- or something to that effect.
* The ActionQueue will then run all the actions in the queue in sequence.
*
*/

/*
* The constructor with lots of parameters is DEPRECATED.
*
* The @p config parameter is passed on to conduit actions that may be in the queue.
*
* @p conduits is a list of .desktop filenames (without the extension); for each conduit,
* a ConduitProxy action is created, which loads the conduit and runs the SyncAction
* from that conduit.
*
* For FileInstallers, pass in the list of filenames and the directory in @p installDir
* and @p installFiles.
*
* When you create an ActionQueue, pass in all the necessary conduit- and filenames.
* You cannot change them later. You must also call prepare() to add all the items
* to the queue; ie.
*
* ActionQueue s(p,c,QStringList(),"/tmp","foo.prc");
*
* Creates a queue with some information set, but without any actions in it.
* Next, call prepare() or somesuch:
*
* s.prepareSync();
*
* This will add a buch of "standard" actions to the queue for a HotSync, ie. a
* welcome message action, user check, the conduits (if any; none were specified in the
* constructor above), a file install action (which will try to install /tmp/foo.prc) and
* some cleanup actions.
*
*
* Alternatively, you can use addAction() to fill up the stack yourself.
