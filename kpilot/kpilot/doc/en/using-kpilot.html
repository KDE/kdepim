    <A NAME="using"><H2>Using KPilot v2.0</H2></A>
    <p>When KPilot is run for the first time it will display the
      settings dialog.  The default device is /dev/pilot (which should be a
      link to the proper device for the pilot) though this is configurable.
      Please verify this is correct.  Other settings can be configured at
      this time but are not mandatory (though HIGHLY recommended).  The one
      setting that you might want to take notice
      of is <B>Local overrides pilot</B>.  Setting this to true means that if
      both the local record and the pilot record are modified, during the
      next hot sync the local record will be considered the valid one and
      both will be set to that. By default the Pilot is considered to be the
      valid record and if both the local record and the pilot record have
      been modified the local is overwritten by the pilot copy.  Hitting
      "OK" will continue to the main KPilot screen.</p>
    <p>It is recommended you preform a full backup of your Pilot at
      this point so that all of the data visible in KPilot is accurate and
      any importing or exporting is properly merged the next time you
      hot-sync.  You can do a full backup of your Pilot by selecting Backup
      from the File Menu.</p>

    <A NAME="settings"><H2>Configuring KPilot</H2></A>

    <H3>General Settings</H3>
    <P>The settings dialog is accessible from the File menu.  The
      first tab of the settings dialog is the general configuration
      for KPilot.  <B>Pilot Device</B> refers to the device KPilot
      should use to talk to the Palm Pilot.  By default this is
      <TT>/dev/pilot</TT>, which should be a link to the appropriate
      device.  <B>Pilot User</B> should be your user name, but at this 
      point is unused.</P>
    <P><B>Sync Mail</B> refers to whether or not KPilot should check
      for new incoming mail on the POP server, and send any outgoing
      mail from the Pilot during the next hot-sync.</P>
    <P><B>Sync Files</B> refers to whether or not KPilot should
      attempt to install any files pending in the <a
	href="using-kpilot.html#installer">file install utility</a>
      during the next hot-sync.</P>
    <P><B>Local overrides Pilot</B> sets whether KPilot or the Palm
      Pilot has the final say on modified records.  By this, if the
      same record is changed on KPilot and on the Palm Pilot, which
      one is kept as the most current.</P>
    <p><B>Start Hot-Sync Daemon at login</b> setups up the daemon so
      that it is run by KDE as soon as you log in.  This allows you to 
      hot-sync by just hitting the hot-sync button without the need to 
      launch KPilot. <BR><i>NOTE: You cannot do mail syncing without
	KPilot running.  See the next setting.</i>
    <p><b>Start KPilot at Hot-Sync</b> is only relavent if you are
      running the daemon.  When you begin a hot-sync, if KPilot is not 
      currently running the Daemon will start it up for you.  Note
      that you will have to exit it after you are finished syncing.
    <p><b>Show Daemon in KPanel</b> allows the daemon to dock itself
      onto the Panel.  This gives you visual feedback to hot-syncing,
      allows you to kill the daemon by right clicking and picking
      exit, and will accept dropped files/urls to be installed during
      the next hot-sync.

    <H3>Email Settings</H3>

    <P><b>Email Address</b> is simply your email address.</P>
    <p><b>Signature</b> is the <i>name of the file</i> of your signature to 
      be appended to any outgoing email. This is relative to your home 
    directory.</p>
    <p><b>Sendmail Cmd</b> is the command to be invoked to send any
      outgoing email.  It is usually correct as is.</p>
    <p><b>The Pop settings</b> are the server, port, and username to be
      used to retrieve your mail.</p>
    <p><b>Leave mail on server</b> instructs KPilot to leave any new 
      mail on the POP server when syncing with the Palm Pilot.  This
      allows you to grab the email using your regular browser
      later.</p>
    <p><b>Sync incoming and outgoing mail</b> refers to whether KPilot
      should check for new mail on the POP server and send any pending 
      mail from the Palm Pilot respectively.</p>

    <H3>Address Settings</H3>

    <p><b>Import and Export Format</b> are the formats any imported or 
      exported addresses will have.  No spaces should appear in the
      format specification.  The same delimeter should be used
      throughout, for example, a comma.</p>
    <p><b>Use Key Field</b> instructs KPilot to use the first field in 
      the specification as a key field for finding already existing
      addresses.  When addresses are imported into KPilot and <b>Use
	Key Field</b> is turned on, a matching record will be updated
      with the information read from the import file.  If it is turned 
      off, a new address will be created for each entry in the import
      file.  <i>Note that the first field in the import/export format is
      the key field!</i></p>


<A NAME="memo"><H2>The Memo Utility</H2></A>
    
    <p>The memo viewer allows you to view the memos on your pilot,
      export them to text files, import new ones to be installed the next 
      time you hot-sync, or edit existing ones.
    
<A NAME="address"><H2>The Address Utility</H2></A>
    <p>The address viewer lets you view, import, export and edit
      addresses to and from the Pilot.  The import and export format is
      configurable via the <a
	href="using-kpilot.html#settings">settings dialog</a>.  Note
      that the first field in the 
      import format is used as the key field.  That is, if <b>Use Key
	Field</b> is 
      turned on in the settings dialog, when importing if KPilot sees
      another record with a matching "Key Field" the existing record is
      updated to reflect the new data being read in.  If no such record
      exists, a new record is created.  The default is not to use the key
      field, so every record read in from the import file is created and
      added to the database.</p>

<A NAME="installer"><H2>The File Installer</H2></A>
    <p>	To use the file installer supports dragging and dropping of
      files into the file list area if you are using KFM, or just hit the
      Add File button to add a file if you are not.  These files will
      be installed on your Palm Pilot during the next hot sync if Sync
      Files is checked in the settings dialog.  If you choose not to
      install the files on the Palm Pilot, just hit Clear List to
      remove any pending files.  <i>Note that an internal copy of the
      file is kept, so you can even drag and drop URLs from KFM's
      browser!</i>
      <p>Also, if you are using the Hot-Sync Daemon you may drag and
      drop files/urls onto the docked icon on the tool bar.  Provided
      <b>Sync Files</b> is checked in the <a
	href="using-kpilot.html#settings">settings dialog</a> they
      will be installed the next time you hot-sync.
