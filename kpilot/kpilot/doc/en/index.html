To KPilot v3.1</I></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<H5>What is it?</H5>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>  </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">KPilot 3.1
is the latest version of the Desktop HotSync software for Unix. 
After several release and contributions from users KPilot, along with
KOrganizer, has evolved into a rather complete replacement for the
Windows Desktop  provided by 3Com.  KPilot offers a few internal
tools for viewing and manipulating data, and a convenient API for
developing ways of sharing data with other applications.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<H5>Setting it up...</H5>
<P>  <FONT SIZE=2>Once KPilot is installed it is rather easy to set
up.  Run <I>kpilot</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> from either
the panel menu or from the command prompt and it will prompt you with
a dialog box asking you to configure it for the first time.  These
options are the following:</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Pilot Device</B>: <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">This
is the serial port that the cradle is connected to.  By default it is
set to </SPAN></FONT><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><CODE><FONT SIZE=2>/dev/pilot</FONT></CODE>
<FONT SIZE=2>which should be a symbolic link to the proper serial
port.  </FONT></SPAN><FONT SIZE=2><B>Make sure the serial port has
the correct permissions.</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">  It
must be read/write by all if KPilot is intended to be used by a
normal user!  This is done by doing a <CODE>chmod 666 /dev/____ <FONT FACE="times">where
'____' is the correct serial port.</FONT></CODE></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="times">Pilot User: </FONT></FONT></B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="times">This
is the user name of the pilot.  By default this name is the same as
your log on name.  When you first sync with the pilot KPilot will
check to see if this name matches the one on the pilot.  If they do
not, you are asked to pick which you will use.  If you pick the local
name, the pilot will be changed to match.  This is also used to store
the information synced from the pilot.  For example, if I were to
hot-sync my pilot on your machine, it would store the data into a
subdirectory named 'pilone'.</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Sync Files: </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">When
this is enabled any files dropped into the file install (either the
icon docked on the panel or into the file installer widget in KPilot)
will be installed on the pilot during the next hot-sync.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Local overrides Pilot: </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">When
a record has been modified on both the Pilot and the local side, only
one can be kept.  By default KPilot assumes the Pilot has the most
recent information and will keep that.  By enabling this option
KPilot assumes <I>it</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> has the
most recent information and will overwrite the pilot's copy.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Start
Hot-Sync Daemon at login:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> By
enabling this a link to the daemon is placed in your autostart folder
and will be started automatically.  Note that this is not normally
needed if the daemon is docked in the panel.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Start
KPilot at Hot-Sync:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> When the
hot-sync button is pressed on the cradle (assuming the daemon is
running) KPilot can sync without actually starting up the GUI. 
However, by enabling this option the daemon will start up the KPilot
GUI when the hot-sync begins.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=2>You
can safely ignore the Address Settings for right now.  They are used
for importing or exporting addresses from a text file.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=2>Once
KPilot is properly set up, pressing OK will bring up the main KPilot
window.  The <B>first </B>thing you should do is a <B>Full Backup</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
of the Pilot.  Do this by selecting File-&gt;Backup.  When you do,
the status bar will ask you to press the hot-sync button on the
cradle.  Assuming everything is set up properly you should see the
pilot begin to sync and a message box telling you what databases are
being backed up.  This will back up your entire pilot into your local
directory.  Note that this may take a little while, however a normal
hot-sync is significantly faster.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
