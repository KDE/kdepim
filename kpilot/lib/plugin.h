* in a dialog. This is the currently preferred form for configuration,
* and it's what is used in the KPilot conduit configuration dialog.
* The factory is asked for a "ConduitConfigBase" object.
*
* NB. The reason that this is a QObject which needs to create a
* separate widget - instead of a QWidget subclass - has to do with
* layouting. If you make the widget with designer then the easiest
* thing to do is to use a grid layout there. Making ConduitConfigBase
* a QWidget subclass would require an additional layout here, which

* the conduit was compiled against. Additionally, a plugin may have a
