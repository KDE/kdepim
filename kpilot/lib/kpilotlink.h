/**
* Tickle handling.
*
* During a HotSync, the Pilot expects to be kept awake by (nearly)
* continuous communication with the PC. The Pilot doesn't like
* long periods of inactivity, since they drain the batteries while
* the communications hardware is kept powered up. If the period of
* inactivity is too long, the Pilot times out, shuts down the
* communication, and the HotSync is broken.

* Sometimes, however, periods of inactivity cannot be avoided --
* for instance, if you _have_ to ask the user something during a
* sync, or if you are fetching a large amount of data from a slow
* source (libkabc can do that, if your addressbook is on an LDAP
* server). During these periods of inactivity (as far as the Pilot
* can tell), you can "tickle" the Pilot to keep it awake. This
* prevents the communications from being shut down. It's not
* a good idea to do this all the time -- battery life and possible
* corruption of the dlp_ communications streams. Hence, you should
* start and stop tickling the Pilot around any computation which:
*   - may take a long time
*   - does not in itself _ever_ communicate directly with the Pilot
*
*
*
* You can call slot tickle() whenever you like just to do a
* dlp_tickle() call on the Pilot. It will return true if the
* tickle was successful, false otherwise (this can be used to
* detect if the communication with the Pilot has shut down for
* some reason).
*
* The protected methods startTickle() and stopTickle() are intended
* to be called only from SyncActions -- I can't think of any other
* legitimate use, since everything being done during a HotSync is
* done via subclasses of SyncActions anyway, and SyncAction provides
* access to these methods though its own start- and stopTickle().
*
* Call startTickle with a timeout in seconds, or 0 for no timeout.
* This timeout is _unrelated_ to the timeout in the Pilot's
* communications. Instead, it indicates how long to continue
* tickling the Pilot before emitting the timeout() signal. This
* can be useful for placing an upper bound on the amount of
* time to wait for, say, user interaction -- you don't want an
* inattentive user to drain the batteries during a sync because
* he doesn't click on "Yes" for some question. If you pass a
* timeout of 0, the Pilot will continue to be tickled until you
* call stopTickle().
*
* Call stopTickle() to stop tickling the Pilot and continue with
* normal operation. You _must_ call stopTickle() before calling
* anything else that might communicate with the Pilot, to avoid
* corrupting the dlp_ communications stream. (TODO: Mutex the heck
* out of this to avoid this problem). Note that stopTickle() may
* hang up the caller for a small amount of time (up to 200ms)
* before returning.
*
* event() and TickleTimeoutEvent are part of the implementation
* of tickling, and are only accidentally visible.
*
* Signal timeout() is emitted if startTickle() has been called
* with a non-zero timeout and that timeout has elapsed. The
* tickler is stopped before timeout is emitted.
