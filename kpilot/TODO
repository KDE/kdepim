* Handle real devfs better (regular USB support seems OK now).
* Handle difference between pi_bind() "no such file" error and others.
* Look into possible buffer overflows in pi_socket structure.
* Replace gsetupDialog with files that follow the class naming convention,
  that subclass from KDialogBase, and provide better support for making
  dialogs based on Qt designer widgets.
* Add behavior to the new .ui-based config dialog.
