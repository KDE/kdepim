Specific JOBS
=============

[This is an assignment for Aron Insinga]

Part I. Make a widget (using Qt designer) for exporting memos. It should have 
at least: (1) The possibility to choose "all" or "currently selected" memos 
to export (2) The possibility to set the filename, using a Browse button at 
the very least (3) Chosing XML or plain text for export. (That's 4 readio 
buttons, 3 labels, a groupbox or two and a pushbutton and a QLineEdit in 
total, I think.) Base your widget on a Qt Widget -- *NOT* a dialog. Then it 
fits into KPilot better.

Part II. (Optional) Add a "Always save only selected memo" option to the 
KPilot configuration dialog 
(kdepim/kpilot/kpilot/kpilotConfigDialog_base..ui) and make sure it gets 
saved to the config file (KPilotConfigDialog::commitChanges and also some 
work on ..../kpilotConfig.{h,cc})

Part III. Write a function saveAsXML(const QString &fileName,const char 
*memoData) that writes said memo text to a file with the given name.
