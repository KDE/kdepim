This is a TODO file. Open issues are marked with a *, partly resolved issues
are marked with a +, ignored issues get an o, and resolved issues a -.
Check the ChangeLog for details on how an issue is resolved, since resolved
issues are periodically purged from this list.

General TODO
============

* Adjust the time of events to allow for the timezone KOrganizer is in.
* Make the FileInstallWidget use a KDirWatcher.
* Handle real devfs better (regular USB support seems OK now).
* Handle difference between pi_bind() "no such file" error and others.
* Add malsync conduit.
* Fix local database & do regression testing
* How *do* you sync KNotes with the memo pad? This is hard.
* Make the popmail conduit use the ioslaves.
* Make the address book conduit use libkab (or whatever it's called now).
+ Make daemon able to sync more than once in a run.
+ Close device at end of sync.
+ Port conduits to new setup.
o Make the kpilotTest program able to do more than one sync in a run.
o Make pi_install_file amenable to use in a GUI program. [Move to a thread
  in KDE3 and leave unsolved in KDE2]
- Add conduit-sync in the daemon as well.
- Look into possible buffer overflows in pi_socket structure.
- Add a validator ensuring path lengths are kept < 14 chars for 
  pilot-link <= 0.9.5
- Use KJanusWidget for main window area, to make various views
  more apparent.
- Remove the exec()-style code for old conduits. Fixup the messages, too.
- Possibly move the message and progress bar to the log window as well.


Specific JOBS
=============

[This is an assignment for Aron Insinga]

Part I. Make a widget (using Qt designer) for exporting memos. It should have 
at least: (1) The possibility to choose "all" or "currently selected" memos 
to export (2) The possibility to set the filename, using a Browse button at 
the very least (3) Chosing XML or plain text for export. (That's 4 readio 
buttons, 3 labels, a groupbox or two and a pushbutton and a QLineEdit in 
total, I think.) Base your widget on a Qt Widget -- *NOT* a dialog. Then it 
fits into KPilot better.

Part II. (Optional) Add a "Always save only selected memo" option to the 
KPilot configuration dialog 
(kdepim/kpilot/kpilot/kpilotConfigDialog_base..ui) and make sure it gets 
saved to the config file (KPilotConfigDialog::commitChanges and also some 
work on ..../kpilotConfig.{h,cc})

Part III. Write a function saveAsXML(const QString &fileName,const char 
*memoData) that writes said memo text to a file with the given name.
