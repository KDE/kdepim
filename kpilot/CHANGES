1/21/99:
	o Fixed a bug that may be causing the multiple sync thing.
	o Installed the signal handler for kpilotDaemon.  It should clean
	  after itself now.
	o Added checkboxes for todoconduit and vcalconduit.
8/16/98:
	o Changed the sockets that KPilot and KPilotDaemon use so they 
	  don't interfere with anything (hopefully) other programs.
1/14/2000:
	o KPilot is now in the KDE CVS repository. Active development
	  on the 3.1 release has resumed and a 3.1final is expected
	  Real Soon Now (tm)
1/31/2000:
	o Yeah, right.
	o Changed popmail and null conduit and the KPilot setup job
	  so they have similar setup-dialog styles. Also changed the
	  menu layout and the toolbar.
7/20/2000:
	o 3.2.0 (i.e. 3.1final) is being ported to KDE 2 and is now 
	  called KPilot 4.0.0
8/30/2000:
	o Fixed drag-n-drop file installation.  Both the docking widget
	  the main KPilot list work.
	o Added ServiceType support for conduits.  Conduits are now 
	  found by looking for the KPilotConduit type.  This fits better
	  into KDE 2's architecture and is much more flexible for us.
	  Conduits still don't work quite yet, but it finds them now.
