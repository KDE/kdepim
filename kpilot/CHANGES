1/21/99:
	o Fixed a bug that may be causing the multiple sync thing.
	o Installed the signal handler for kpilotDaemon.  It should clean
	  after itself now.
	o Added checkboxes for todoconduit and vcalconduit.
8/16/98:
	o Changed the sockets that KPilot and KPilotDaemon use so they 
	  don't interfere with anything (hopefully) other programs.
1/14/2000:
	o KPilot now resides in the KDE CVS repository; release 3.1b12
	  is the current release.
