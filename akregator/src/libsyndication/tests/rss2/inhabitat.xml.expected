description: #Of all of the materials I wouldn't want to wear, rubber is right up at the top. It doesn't breathe, it catches the little hairs on your arms...but creating dancers' costumes out of rubber bands led designer Elodie Blanchard to great inspirations for home decor, which she produces under the name ElasticCo. <br/> <br/>The most commercially appealing among her varied designs is the Mesh Collection, a line of tabletop accessories and lighting made with many small, colorful rubber bands. The containers are great for holding perishables that need a little ventilation in order to stay fresh, and the lamps diffuse light beautifully onto surrounding surfaces. <br/> <br/>I wouldn't want to dance in a rubberband get-up, but I'd stash my fruit in an ElasticCo. bowl any day. <br/> <br/>+ elasticco.com#
