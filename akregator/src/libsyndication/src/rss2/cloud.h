/**
   * Cloud information for an RSS channel.
   * It specifies a web service that supports the rssCloud interface which can
   * be implemented in HTTP-POST, XML-RPC or SOAP 1.1.
   * Its purpose is to allow processes to register with a cloud to be notified
   * of updates to the channel,
   * implementing a lightweight publish-subscribe protocol for RSS feeds.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * Domain="rpc.sys.com", port="80", path="/RPC2"
   * registerProcedure="myCloud.rssPleaseNotify" protocol="xml-rpc"
   *
   * In this example, to request notification on the channel it appears in,
   * you would send an XML-RPC message to rpc.sys.com on port 80, with a path
   * of /RPC2. The procedure to call is myCloud.rssPleaseNotify.
   *
   * For more information on the rssCloud interface see
   * @link http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/soapMeetsRss#rsscloudInterface
