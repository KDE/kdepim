/**
 * @brief A mapper maps an AbstractDocument to something else.
 * The type of this "something else" is specified by the template
 * parameter T.
 * In the default implementation it is used with the Feed interface,
 * but its not limited to that. T can be an arbitrary class, but must
 * inherit from KShared (so it can be used with shared pointers).
 * 
 * There are three use cases that require you to implement your own
 * mapper (usually it shouldn't be necessary though).
 * For more information on the possible uses, see TODO: link docs.
 * 
 * 1) Add your own feed parser. In case you need support for another
 * feed format (Okay! News, CDF, totally backward-incompatible Atom 5.0, ... 
 * you name it), you can 
 * implement AbstractParser and AbstractDocument for it and provide a 
 * Mapper&lt;Feed>
 *  
 * * @code
 * class OkayNewsMapper : public Mapper<Feed>
 * {
 *     public:
 * 
 *     virtual FeedPtr map(AbstractDocumentPtr doc) const { ... }
 * };
 * 
 * parserCollection()->registerParser(new OkayNews::Parser, new OkayNewsMapper);
 * @endcode
 * 
 * 2) Implement your own mapper for the Feed abstraction, for an
 * existing parser. E.g. if you think LibSyndication does map Atom
 * all wrong, you can implement your own Atom mapper and use that instead
 * of the default one.
 * 
 * @code
 * class MyAtomMapper : public Mapper<Feed>
 * {
 *     public:
 * 
 *     virtual FeedPtr map(AbstractDocumentPtr doc) const { ... }
 * };
 * 
 * parserCollection()->changeMapper("atom", new MyAtomMapper);
 * @endcode
 * 
 * 3) Use your own abstraction. In case the Feed interface
 * does not fit your needs, you can use your own interface, let's 
 * say "MyFeed". Be aware you have to implement custom mappings for
 * all feed formats then:
 * 
 * @code
 * class MyFeed : public KShared
 * {
 *     public:
 * 
 *     QString title() const; // my special title
 *     QList<Article> articles() const; // I name it articles
 * };
 * 
 * class MyAtomMapper : public Mapper<MyFeed> { ... };
 * class MyRDFMapper : public Mapper<MyFeed> { ... };
 * class MyRSS2Mapper : public Mapper<MyFeed> { ... };
 * 
 * ParserCollection<MyFeed>* coll = new ParserCollection<MyFeed>;
 * coll->registerParser(new Atom::Parser, new MyAtomMapper);
 * coll->registerParser(new RDF::Parser, new MyRDFMapper);
   coll->registerParser(new RSS2::Parser, new MyRSS2Mapper);
 * @endcode
 *
