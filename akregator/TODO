TODO-list for aKregator
=======================

Yes, this is (mostly) a roadmap of new features
and bug fixes, not small ones.

Feel free to add items, there is an ideas section
at the end.

short term (~beta5)
-------------------
- passive popups (will be in shell)
- systray icon menu (showing unread feeds/items)
- add back/forward/reload buttons to pageviewer
- combined view fixen
  -> show read/unread/new as different colors in combined view
  -> allow searching in combined view
- add color configurability
- add option to open tabs in background

medium term ()
---------

long term
---------
- move out of kdenonbeta
- ship as part of kde 4.0?

ideas
-----
- webblog editor (see krsseditor?)
- search folders like kmail
- client side archiving
  -> smt: doable in <30 lines of code but do we want to do it?
  -> berkus: yes, i would love to keep an archive of all read feeds in akregator
- a small button that appears in konqueror's statusbar
  if a page appears to have a rss feed.. automatically
  adds page to akregator
  -> smt: will have to research the feasibility..

other
-----
- need to ask on kmail/kde-core-devel mailinglist about the new welcome page and the graphics for it (KMail/Konqueror one rocks, but we need aKregator pictures for it)
- new texts for the welcome page
