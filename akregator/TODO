== LONG-TERM ==

#000032 ADD [+] proposals for librss:
                [+] add complete RSS 2.0 support to Article, namely add Article::pubDate, const QString& Article::guid() and bool Article::guidIsPermalink();
                [-] put unparsed <item> children into QMap and add const QString& attribute(const QString &tagName) (almost any other rss, the only problem is that there are many <tag attrib1="x" attrib2="y"> in feeds..); (reason: does not fit frerich's orthogonality principle)
                [ ] add Document::timeToLive() in minutes - time to cache (RSS 2.0).
                [ ] add content:encoded support (see http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000770.html)
#000014 ADD [ ] provide .spec file for RPM packaging (or at least let packagers know about it)
