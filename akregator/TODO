== SHORT-TERM (URGENT) ==

#000034 FIX [ ] parse html entities in article titles
#000032 ADD [+] proposals for librss:
                add complete RSS 2.0 support to Article, namely add Article::pubDate, const QString& Article::guid() and bool Article::guidIsPermalink();
                put unparsed <item> children into QMap and add const QString& attribute(const QString &tagName) (almost any other rss, the only problem is that there are many <tag attrib1="x" attrib2="y"> in feeds..);
                add Document::ttl() in minutes - time to cache (RSS 2.0).
#000031 ADD [ ] Autosave: Remember feeds list in "current" file
#000029 CHG [ ] "Modify" should enable in-line edit for feed group items, standard dialog for feeds
#000021 ADD [ ] store fetched articles to Article Archive
#000027 CHG [ ] when changing current feed, change article in m_html also
#000003 ADD [ ] sort ArticleList by Article::pubDate (NOT in current librss!)
#000004 ADD [ ] update ArticleList when selecting feed group - show articles from all child feeds, sorted by pubDate
#000005 FIX [ ] reimplement back with ArticleList::m_map - to allow selecting items from multiple feeds in single view (re: need to map to a source feed also?)
#000006 ADD [ ] system tray
#000007 ADD [ ] DCOP (q: should KPart implement DCOP or shell app only?)
#000008 ADD [ ] install mime-type handlers for .opml feeds
#000012 FIX [ ] refine aboutbox
#000019 ADD [ ] implement tooltips and What's This? help

== MID-TERM ==

#000033 ADD [ ] quicksearch bar a-la kmail
#000009 ADD [ ] write user documentation
#000010 ADD [ ] code doxymentation
#000011 ADD [ ] draw appropriate app icons
#000020 ADD [ ] announce on the <kde-announce@kde.org> mailing list
#000013 FIX [ ] list generated files in .cvsignore files -- add addfeeddialog.{cpp,h}
#000022 ADD [ ] configure.in.in magic to detect librss presence
#000025 FIX [ ] fix path in m_html->begin( KURL( "file:/tmp/something.html" ) ) so that images and css can be embedded in article preview

== LONG-TERM ==

#000014 ADD [ ] provide .spec file for RPM packaging (or at least let packagers know about it)
#000015 ADD [ ] provide debian directory and configuration files for Debian packaging (or at least let packagers know about it)

== IDEAS ==

* Implement Akregator::Article which will contain RSS::Article ref, bool persistent flag, associated QListViewItem * if present (?!?), Archive ID for article and will encapsulate article manipulation.
