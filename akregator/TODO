TODO-list for aKregator
=======================

Yes, this is (mostly) a roadmap of new features
and bug fixes, not small ones.

Feel free to add items, there is an ideas section
at the end.

short term (~beta3)
-------------------
- add smarter feed caching (in librss), using If-Modified-Since http header
- interval polling (will be in shell)
- passive popups (will be in shell)
- add back/forward/reload buttons to pageviewer
- rewrite combined view.. planning to use khtml/dom directly
  -> show read/unread/new as different colors in combined view
  -> allow searching in combined view
- add a kontact part


medium term ()
---------

long term
---------
- move out of kdenonbeta
- ship as part of kde 4.0?

ideas
-----
- webblog editor (see krsseditor?)
- search folders like kmail
- client side archiving
  -> smt: doable in <30 lines of code but do we want to do it?
  -> berkus: yes, i would love to keep an archive of all read feeds in akregator
- a small button that appears in konqueror's statusbar
  if a page appears to have a rss feed.. automatically
  adds page to akregator
  -> smt: will have to research the feasibility..
