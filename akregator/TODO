TODO-list for aKregator
=======================

Yes, this is (mostly) a roadmap of new features
and bug fixes, not small ones.

Feel free to add items, there is a ideas section
in the end.

short term (~beta2)
-------------------
- interval polling
  -> smt: this will have to be implemented in the shell
          to work properly. We have to find a way
	  to let the shell tell the part to fetch feeds
	  though. Tricky. The other way is easy; however
	  a interval tracker on the shell side should
	  not know about Feed objects, just urls. The
	  part should alert the interval tracker, either
	  through slots or through the BrowserInterface,
	  when a url has been fetched. That part is easy.
- passive popups
  -> smt: needs interval polling?
- add back/forward/reload buttons to pageviewer
- allow searching in combined view
- show read/unread/new as different colors
  in combined view.

medium term (~beta3?)
-----------
- rewrite combined
- config dialog
  -> smt: if someone wants to do it in b2, go ahead :)
  -> changing middle mouse button action to config dialog
- kontact part

long term
---------
- move out of kdenonbeta
- ship as part of kde 4.0?

ideas
-----
- webblog editor
- search folders like kmail
- client side archiving
  -> smt: doable in <30 lines of code but do we want to do it?
- an small button that appears in konqueror's statusbar
  if a page appears to have a rss feed.. automatically
  adds page to akregator
  -> smt: will have to research the feasibility..
