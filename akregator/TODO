ADD new feature

== SHORT-TERM (URGENT) ==

#000042 FIX [ ] "File | Save" without previously selected filename doesn't work (doesn't call "Save As...")
#000041 FIX [ ] order for dateless items (right now they show in random order)
                order should be: ordered for items with dates, order same as in rss for items without dates.
#000040 ADD [ ] finally, add some configuration options
                [ ] default LiveJournal username and password (use KWallet)
                [ ] last open opml file
#000036 ADD [+] write CSS to the KHTMLPart in viewing articles -->smt
                [ ] if the channel image size is well-sized, show in headers -->smt
                [ ] handle palette changes (color changes in kcontrol)
#000031 ADD [ ] Autosave: Remember feeds list in "current" file
                Elaborate: when user saves file, remember as current and restore from it,
                if file is unsaved, store it to data/current.opml.
#000025 FIX [ ] fix path in m_html->begin( KURL( "file:/tmp/something.html" ) ) so that local images and css can be referenced from article preview   --> smt
#000043 ADD [ ] download feed image specified for RSS (for #000036) --> smt
#000021 ADD [ ] store fetched articles to Article Archive
#000027 CHG [ ] when changing current feed, change article in m_html also
#000004 ADD [ ] update ArticleList when selecting feed group - show articles from all child feeds, sorted by pubDate
#000005 FIX [ ] reimplement back with ArticleList::m_map - to allow selecting items from multiple feeds in single view (re: need to map to a source feed also?) (correction: might not be necessary now that we have ArticleListItem)
#000007 ADD [ ] DCOP (q: should KPart implement DCOP or shell app only?)
#000008 ADD [ ] install mime-type handlers for .opml feed lists
#000019 ADD [ ] implement tooltips and What's This? help

== MID-TERM ==

#000033 ADD [ ] quicksearch bar a-la kmail
#000009 ADD [ ] write user documentation
#000010 ADD [ ] code doxymentation
#000011 ADD [ ] draw appropriate app icons
#000020 ADD [ ] announce on the <kde-announce@kde.org> mailing list
#000022 ADD [ ] configure.in.in magic to detect librss presence

== LONG-TERM ==

#000032 ADD [+] proposals for librss:
                [+] add complete RSS 2.0 support to Article, namely add Article::pubDate, const QString& Article::guid() and bool Article::guidIsPermalink();
                [-] put unparsed <item> children into QMap and add const QString& attribute(const QString &tagName) (almost any other rss, the only problem is that there are many <tag attrib1="x" attrib2="y"> in feeds..); (reason: does not fit frerich's orthogonality principle)
                [ ] add Document::timeToLive() in minutes - time to cache (RSS 2.0).
                [ ] add content:encoded support (see http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000770.html)
#000014 ADD [ ] provide .spec file for RPM packaging (or at least let packagers know about it)
#000015 ADD [ ] provide debian directory and configuration files for Debian packaging (or at least let packagers know about it)
