KNotes -- Notes for the K Desktop Environment
=============================================

  KNotes aims to be a useful and full featured notes application for
the KDE project. It tries to be as fast and lightweight as possible
although including some advanced features.

  KNotes conforms to the KDEPIM coding standards:

History
=======

  KNotes was originally started by Bernd Wuebben for KDE 1. The goal 
was mainly to test and extend the KWM Communications Protocol as it 
was quite limited back then.

  Wynn Wilkes did the initial port of KNotes to the next generation 
of KDE, KDE 2. Some (hopefully rarely used) features where not ported.

  Michael Brade took over as the maintainer after the port to KDE 2 and
did a great job if I might add.

  A bit after KDE 4 porting had started the proverbial torch fell on
my lap and is still there today, I fear it might leave third degree 
burns.

Feedback
========

  If you have any feedback, suggestions, new features or little
enhancements, please don't hesitate to drop me a mail, call or
postcard.
