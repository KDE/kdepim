	* Added option "dock in panel" (to disable docking)
	Docking is automatically re-enabled if the last note is deleted
	* Move options submenu to toplevel RMB menu (too many submenus!)
	* Re-added "Quit" menu entry (in order to quit when docking is off)

1999-02-16  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* fixed SIGSEV caused by double-clicking on empty places.
	* introduced a simple sessionWidget that will catch the
        saveYourself() signal from the session manager and invoke saving all
        data. This is more robust than having concurring methods in every
        widget and works without the saved_already_for_session_management
        variable that was NOT unset if the user cancelled the shutdown (bug !)
	* renaming: missing slash broke renaming.
        * set atomic flag in cleanup(). Hope to have avoided occasional crash
        leading to data loss.
	* Replaced ~/.kde with KApplication::localkdedir()
        * option menu: disabled illogical switch between "3D frame" and
        "no frame" label. It is a checkable entry!

	* KNotes are now automatically saved all 15 minutes. 
	* added explicit save command on request.

	* knotes recognizes urls now.
	* Fixed up knotes and implemented docking properly

	* knotes.cpp: knotes now save themselves on X sever exit

	* added all necessary stuff for locale (klocale->translate())

Sat Nov 22 13:13:05 1997 Matthias Ettrich <ettrich@kde.org>

	* sessionmanagement: uses kwm properties now, not only geometry info
	* look: pretty thin border. KPostit does no longer inherit QMultiline
	        but simply QFrame. New class: KPostitMultilineEdit.
	        New QMessage box for warning. Icon+Miniicon.
	* feel: moving possible with the label, rmb menu contains toDesktop
	        and sticky, notes are activated not only raised. Alt-F4
	        can remove a note now.
	* invokation: change: siguser1 will give you a new knote (like
	        taking a new paper from a block).
	        "-knotes_restore" used for session management.
	        Do NOT use "-restore" since kapplication filters this!
