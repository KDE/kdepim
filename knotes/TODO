TODO for KNotes
===============

features:
 * alarms for the notes
 * categories for the notes
 * improve printing:
    - width of the text on the paper should fit note width if not bigger
      than the paper width
    - print the note title as well
 * the config dialog:
    - make the frame configurable (3d -> normal)
    - make the keybindings configurable
 * support images
 * support urls
 * save cursor and scrollbar postion
 * steal some ideas from Stickies (Mac OS X)
 * steal some ideas from ATNotes (Win)

 * once we have more session configs make KNotes save its notes in
   .kde/share/apps/knotes/<session-name>/

bugs:
 * fix shortcuts
 * add ToolTips everywhere
 * fix being able to uncheck all formatting buttons
 * use KWinDecorations instead of home-made decoration
 * if the window state is changed from outside KNotes the buttons do not
   reflect that
 * in rich text mode: what should happen to the font setting in the config dialog?
 * find out how to avoid the reparent call in KNote

perhaps:
 * transparent notes
 * shadow for the notes
 * icons for the notes (small, put in the note menu and note title)

older TODOs from Wynn:
 * inserting calendar
 * hide/unhide all/some/one ?
 * better pipe error checking
 * standart error redirection in piping
 * changing icon -- empty / non empty
 * handle KNotes files of which all/some may reside on the desktop?
   (means that there must be an extension for note files...)

always open TODO:
 * make the code as perfect and clean as possible!!
