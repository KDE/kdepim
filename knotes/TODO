Still so much !! 

for example:

o insert calendar correctly
o better pipe error checking 
o standart error redirection in piping
o changing icon -- empty / non empty
o hide unhide all? some ? one ?
o remember screen position and desktop
o handle KNotes files of which all/some may reside on the desktop


KFM issues:

o extensions of knotes files should not be shown. 
o Change icon on the fly on the desktop
