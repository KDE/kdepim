TODOs for KNotes
================

 * transparent notes
 * port to KActions and XMLGUI
 * steal some ideas from Stickies (Mac OS X)
 * save cursor position and scrollbar postion
 * the config dialog:
    - make the frame configureable (3d -> normal)
    - make the keybindings configureable

perhaps:
 * shadow for the notes
 * icons for the notes
 * alarm

older TODOs from Wynn:
 * inserting calendar
 * hide/unhide all/some/one ?
 * better pipe error checking
 * standart error redirection in piping
 * changing icon -- empty / non empty
 * handle KNotes files of which all/some may reside on the desktop?
   (means that there must be an extension for note files...)

Always open TODO:
 * make the code as perfect and clean as possible!!
